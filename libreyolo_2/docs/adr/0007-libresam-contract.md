# ADR 0007: LibreSAM Contract For Promptable Segmentation

- Status: Proposed
- Date: 2026-06-14
- Scope: New model tier (promptable segmentation models — the SAM family)

## Context

LibreYOLO has two model entry points:

- `LibreYOLO(...)` — a weight-sniffing factory over faithful detectors. Every
  member runs one **promptless** forward and returns *all* objects with
  calibrated scores; members register via `can_load` into `BaseModel._registry`.
  `LibreEC` proves masks (`segment` task) live happily here, because its masks
  are produced automatically with no prompt.
- `LibreVLM(...)` — a parallel tier (ADR 0002) for generative open-vocabulary
  detectors. It is separated by **contract fidelity**, not architecture, and
  loads through the permissive `transformers` model API so LibreYOLO ships no
  model source and stays MIT.

Promptable segmentation (the SAM family) fits neither:

- It is **promptable**: a forward is meaningless without a per-image *spatial*
  prompt (a point or box) supplied at call time. "A detection" becomes "the
  thing you pointed at", not "everything found".
- It is **interactive/stateful**: the heavy image encoder runs once
  (`set_image`), then many cheap prompts reuse the cached embedding.
- Its output is **masks**, and its scores are real mask-quality (predicted-IoU)
  values, not detection confidences.

Forcing this through the promptless `InferenceRunner` (preprocess → forward →
postprocess → NMS) would misrepresent the call shape. So, as with LibreVLM, the
line is drawn on contract, and the tier owns its own `predict` surface.

## Decision

Add a third tier, `LibreSAM`, for promptable segmentation. It mirrors LibreVLM's
shape:

- A base class `LibreSAMModel(BaseModel)` that does **not** define `can_load`,
  keeping the family out of the detector `_registry` and the `LibreYOLO`
  factory.
- SAM-1, SAM-2, and EdgeTAM load through the permissive `transformers` APIs and
  ship no model source. SAM-2 and EdgeTAM weights are mirrored in the LibreYOLO
  Hugging Face org.
  MobileSAM uses a native Apache-2.0 port because its TinyViT
  image encoder is not representable as a `transformers` SAM-1/2 checkpoint.
- Returns the same `Results` (with `masks`, plus tight `boxes` derived from the
  masks via `masks_to_boxes`, class id `0` = `"object"`), so downstream code is
  unchanged.

The default family remains **SAM-1** (`facebook/sam-vit-base` / `-large` /
`-huge`), autodownloaded on first use.

| Family | API entry | Weight source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| SAM-1 | `LibreSAM("base")`, `LibreSAM1("base")` | `facebook/sam-vit-*` | Default promptable family. |
| SAM-2 image | `LibreSAM("sam2-tiny")`, `LibreSAM2("tiny")` | `LibreYOLO/LibreSAM2*` | Image segmentation only in v1. |
| EdgeTAM image | `LibreSAM("edgetam")`, `LibreEdgeTAM("edge")` | `LibreYOLO/LibreEdgeTAM` | On-device EdgeTAM profile; image segmentation only in v1. |
| SAM 3 image | `LibreSAM("sam3")`, `LibreSAM3("large")` | `facebook/sam3` | Visual prompts plus concept text prompts; gated custom-license weights. |
| MobileSAM | `LibreSAM("mobilesam")`, `LibreMobileSAM()` | `LibreYOLO/LibreMobileSAM` | Native TinyViT port with converted weights. |
| PicoSAM3 | `LibreSAM("picosam3")`, `LibrePicoSAM3()` | `LibreYOLO/LibrePicoSAM3` | Native 96px ROI CNN; box prompts only. |

## Public API

The surface mirrors the de-facto-standard promptable interface (sourced from
public documentation, clean-room), expressed with LibreYOLO's own loading idiom
(size aliases + autodownload, as LibreVLM does — not checkpoint-filename
dispatch):

```python
from libreyolo import LibreSAM

model = LibreSAM("base")                                   # autodownloads (Apache-2.0)
model.predict("img.jpg", points=[900, 370], labels=[1])    # point  -> mask
model.predict("img.jpg", bboxes=[100, 100, 200, 200])      # box    -> mask
model.predict("img.jpg")                                   # segment everything (grid AMG)

model.set_image("img.jpg")                                 # encode once...
a = model.predict(points=[500, 375], labels=[1])           # ...prompt cheaply
b = model.predict(bboxes=[100, 100, 200, 200])
model.reset_image()

edge = LibreSAM("edgetam")
edge.predict("img.jpg", points=[500, 375], labels=[1])

sam3 = LibreSAM("sam3")
r = sam3.predict("img.jpg", text="yellow school bus")  # all matching instances

r.masks.xy        # polygons
r.boxes.xyxy      # tight boxes derived from masks
```

- Points/boxes accept the documented flexible nesting (`[x, y]` = one object;
  `[[x, y], ...]` = N objects; `[[[x, y], ...], ...]` = grouped per object), and
  numpy arrays. Labels are `1` positive / `0` negative, default all positive.
- `multimask=True` returns *all* of SAM's ambiguity masks per prompt (whole vs
  part); the default returns the single best by predicted IoU.
- `conf` filters by predicted mask-IoU (mask quality, **not** a detection
  confidence). `None` keeps all in the prompted path and applies the family grid
  threshold in "segment everything"; `0.0` disables filtering in either mode.
- `device=` on `predict` moves the model and invalidates the cached embedding.
- SAM 3 visual prompts follow the same contract through `Sam3TrackerModel`.
  Its `text=` extension instead performs Promptable Concept Segmentation through
  a lazily loaded `Sam3Model`; text is mutually exclusive with points and boxes.
  `conf` is the PCS detection score on this path, and returned `names` maps class
  `0` to the requested concept. `conf=None` uses the processor's standard 0.3
  PCS score threshold, while explicit `conf=0.0` keeps all candidates. A text
  call with `source=None` re-encodes the cached image because tracker and PCS
  encoder caches are not shared.
- The image-exemplar name `exemplars=` is reserved for a future PCS extension;
  exemplar prompts are not implemented.

## Internal Contract

`LibreSAMModel` satisfies `BaseModel`'s abstract hooks but overrides `predict()`
/ `__call__` directly rather than driving `InferenceRunner` — the promptless
preprocess/forward/postprocess hooks have no meaning here and raise. The
encode-once lifecycle lives in `set_image()` (caches image embeddings) and is
reused by every later `predict()` until `reset_image()`. A `device=` switch moves
cached embeddings when possible so interactive sessions survive device changes.

| Field             | Meaning                                              |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `FAMILY`          | family id (`sam`, `sam2`, `edgetam`, `sam3`, `mobilesam`, `picosam3`) |
| `FILENAME_PREFIX` | `Libre`-prefixed weights-dir prefix                  |
| `HF_REPOS`        | `{size: hf_repo_id}`; drives autodownload            |
| `INPUT_SIZES`     | `{size: nominal_px}` (the processor/family transform owns resize)|

## Confidence

Returned `conf` is SAM's predicted mask-IoU (mask quality), surfaced honestly as
a soft score, not a calibrated detection confidence. `val()` (mAP) is
unsupported — promptable masks have no fixed class set to score against.

## Licensing

SAM-1 and SAM-2 code and weights are Apache-2.0. SAM-1 loads from the upstream
Hugging Face repositories; SAM-2 loads from LibreYOLO Hugging Face mirrors of
the upstream Transformers-compatible snapshots. MobileSAM code and weights are
Apache-2.0; LibreYOLO carries a native port plus a NOTICE, and the converted
checkpoint is hosted separately as `LibreMobileSAM.pt`.

EdgeTAM code and checkpoints are Apache-2.0. LibreYOLO does not vendor its model
architecture; image inference uses the Apache-2.0 Transformers adapter and
reproduces the pinned upstream square image and prompt-coordinate transforms. The
`LibreYOLO/LibreEdgeTAM` snapshot is converted from `facebook/EdgeTAM` revision
`14d7ecc48c656b94e5184519f698cd5386c5a2bf`, whose raw `edgetam.pt` SHA-256 is
`ed2d4850b8792c239689b043c47046ec239b6e808a3d9b6ae676c803fd8780df`.

PicoSAM3 code and weights are Apache-2.0. LibreYOLO carries only the compact
ROI CNN and downloads `LibrePicoSAM3pico.pt` from the LibreYOLO Hugging Face
mirror, converted unchanged from the pinned upstream revision's
`PicoSAM3_SAM3_student_best.pt`. SAM 2.1 and SAM 3 appear only
in the recorded distillation teacher chain; their code and weights are not
vendored or redistributed by the PicoSAM3 family.

SAM 3 model code is not vendored. LibreYOLO calls the Apache-2.0 Transformers
implementation, while weights download directly from the gated
`facebook/sam3` repository. Users must accept Meta's custom SAM License and
authenticate with Hugging Face. The weights are not MIT or Apache-2.0 and are
not redistributed by LibreYOLO. Loading logs a license notice before download.
The SAM 3 and tracker classes first shipped in Transformers 5.0.0; LibreYOLO's
`sam` extra already has the stricter `transformers>=5.3.0` floor.

SAM 3.1 is explicitly deferred. Its custom-license implementation cannot be
vendored into this MIT repository, and Transformers does not yet support the
3.1 checkpoint. The implementation keeps `HF_REPOS` keyed per size so a future
checkpoint can be added cheaply. The exact trigger is Transformers gaining SAM
3.1 image-model support; then add the repo/alias, rerun parity and smoke tests,
and evaluate whether image checkpoint outputs change. Object Multiplex remains
part of a separate future video plan.

## Out Of Scope (v1)

- SAM-2/SAM-3/EdgeTAM video and memory paths. A follow-up should add one shared
  video-session contract rather than an EdgeTAM-only tracking API.
- SAM 3 image exemplars and SAM 3.1, subject to the trigger above.
- Mask prompts (`masks=`), `train()`, `val()`, and `track()` raise. SAM-1/2/3,
  EdgeTAM, and MobileSAM export also raise; PicoSAM3 alone exports its raw 96px
  ROI CNN to ONNX.
- "Segment everything" is a simplified grid AMG (predicted-IoU threshold +
  box-IoU dedup); it omits stability-score filtering, multi-crop, and mask-IoU
  dedup, and is documented as approximate. The prompted path is the precise API.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Promptable, interactive segmentation behind a familiar predict surface and the
  standard `Results`.
- No change to the detector factory; the family is fully isolated.
- A new SAM variant is a small adapter (repos, sizes).

### Negative

- `BaseModel`'s abstract surface is detector-shaped, so SAM stubs four unused
  hooks (the same tax LibreVLM pays). A future slim `transformers`-backed
  intermediate base could de-duplicate the weight-acquisition/dtype logic the
  two tiers now share.
- The simplified AMG under-segments crowded scenes versus the reference
  generator.
