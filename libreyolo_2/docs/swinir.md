# SwinIR super-resolution

LibreSwinIR provides inference and paired PSNR/SSIM validation for the official
SwinIR 4x super-resolution checkpoints. It uses the canonical `restore` task
and returns the upscaled RGB image in `Results.restored` with
`Results.restore_scale == 4`.

| Size | Official tier | Intended use |
|---|---|---|
| `s` | SwinIR-S lightweight | Lower memory and latency |
| `m` | SwinIR-M real-world | Default real-photo upscaling |
| `l` | SwinIR-L real-world | Highest-capacity tier |

```python
from libreyolo import LibreYOLO

model = LibreYOLO("LibreSwinIRm-restore.pt")
result = model.predict("input.jpg", tile=256, tile_pad=16)
result.save("upscaled.png")
```

Inputs run at native resolution and are reflect-padded to an 8-pixel window
multiple. Tiling is optional and bounds peak memory for large images. Training
and dynamic spatial export are outside the first release. Static ONNX export is
available: backend prediction pads inputs that fit
within the exported canvas and crops the 4x result back to the expected output
shape, but the window attention sees that padding, so sub-canvas inputs
measurably diverge from native inference. Export at the resolution you intend
to run, and prefer native PyTorch inference when fidelity matters.

The architecture is adapted from the official Apache-2.0 SwinIR repository at
commit `6545850fbf8df298df73d81f3e8cba638787c8bd`. See
`libreyolo/models/swinir/NOTICE` and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` for provenance.
