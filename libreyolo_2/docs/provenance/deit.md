## Source checkpoints

The source model repositories declare `license: apache-2.0` and
`pipeline_tag: image-classification`. The converter downloads
`model.safetensors` from the immutable revisions below, verifies its SHA-256,
loads it strictly into timm 1.0.28, then strictly loads the same state
dictionary into LibreYOLO. It does not rename or alter a learned tensor. The
only conversion is a LibreYOLO v1.0 metadata wrapper with the canonical
ImageNet-1k class names.

The generated checkpoint inventory is:

The public mirrors are
[`t`](https://huggingface.co/LibreYOLO/LibreDeiTt-cls),
[`s`](https://huggingface.co/LibreYOLO/LibreDeiTs-cls), and
[`b`](https://huggingface.co/LibreYOLO/LibreDeiTb-cls). Each repository is
public, contains exactly the canonical checkpoint plus `.gitattributes`,
`README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `NOTICE`, and belongs to the LibreYOLO
Classification collection. The Hub LFS SHA-256 and byte count match the table
above. All three bare filenames were then downloaded into a new empty working
directory and strict-loaded through the public `LibreYOLO(...)` factory.

## Ported surface

| LibreYOLO surface | Pinned timm source |
|---|---|
| `nn.py` patch embedding and tokens | `timm/layers/patch_embed.py`, `timm/models/vision_transformer.py` |
| `nn.py` attention, MLP, and transformer blocks | `timm/layers/attention.py`, `timm/layers/mlp.py`, `timm/models/vision_transformer.py` |
| `nn.py` classifier graph and initialization-compatible state layout | `timm/models/vision_transformer.py` |
| `utils.py` evaluation preprocessing | the pinned checkpoint `pretrained_cfg` contract |
| ImageNet WNID validation mapping | `timm/data/_info/imagenet_synsets.txt` |

LibreYOLO implements this graph natively with PyTorch and SDPA. There is no
runtime dependency on timm, Hugging Face Hub, or safetensors. Those packages
are used only by the external-data parity test and the conversion script.

## Preprocessing and published accuracy

All three checkpoints use a 224x224 center crop after a bicubic shorter-edge
resize to `floor(224 / 0.9) = 248`, followed by RGB conversion and ImageNet
normalization with mean `(0.485, 0.456, 0.406)` and standard deviation
`(0.229, 0.224, 0.225)`.

The pinned timm `results/results-imagenet.csv` table reports the following
50,000-image ImageNet-1k validation metrics with that contract:

| Size | Top-1 | Top-5 |
|---|---:|---:|
| `t` | 72.190 | 91.100 |
| `s` | 79.856 | 95.056 |
| `b` | 81.980 | 95.740 |

The released tiny checkpoint was also rerun locally through the public
`model.val()` path on all 50,000 validation images from the gated
`ILSVRC/imagenet-1k` dataset at revision
`49e2ee26f3810fb5a7536bbf732a7b07389a47b5`. It produced 36,083 top-1 and
45,555 top-5 correct predictions: **72.166 top-1** and **91.110 top-5**. Those
results differ from the pinned table by 0.024 and 0.010 percentage points,
respectively, within the 0.05-point acceptance tolerance. The dataset is not
distributed with LibreYOLO.

Every released checkpoint was also compared directly with the pinned timm
graph on the same input and produced `max_abs_diff == 0.0`. The unchanged
learned tensors and exact logits establish that the native graph does not
change the source model's accuracy under the same evaluation transform.

The bundled synset index also lets `model.val()` consume the conventional
`train/<wnid>/` and `val/<wnid>/` layout, including proper absolute head
indices for ImageNet subsets such as Imagenette. Checkpoint results continue
to expose human-readable names.

## Measured evidence

- Tiny checkpoint full ImageNet-1k validation through `model.val()`:
  50,000 images, 36,083 top-1 correct (**72.166%**) and 45,555 top-5 correct
  (**91.110%**), versus the pinned **72.190% / 91.100%** reference.
- Strict state-dictionary loading and exact eager logits for all three pinned
  checkpoints: `max_abs_diff == 0.0`.
- Public prediction smoke on the bundled sample image, including readable
  ImageNet labels and batched classification output.
- Public checkpoints on the 3,925-image Imagenette validation split (top-1 /
  top-5): `t` `0.704713 / 0.923057`, `s` `0.802803 / 0.968153`, and `b`
  `0.844586 / 0.985478`. This exercises `model.val()` with WNID folders and is
  a subset smoke, not a replacement for the published ImageNet-1k figures.
- Tiny checkpoint ONNX Runtime parity: raw-logit maximum absolute difference
  `5.722e-6`, probability maximum absolute difference `2.384e-7`, and exact
  top-1/top-5 indices.
- Tiny checkpoint TorchScript parity: bit-identical raw logits and
  probabilities, with exact top-1/top-5 indices.
- Tiny checkpoint OpenVINO 2026.2 parity: raw cosine similarity `0.99999833`,
  probability cosine similarity `0.99999994`, and exact top-1/top-5 indices.
- Tiny checkpoint TensorRT 10.16 FP16 parity on an NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti: raw
  cosine similarity `0.99998593`, probability cosine similarity `0.999997735`,
  finite outputs, and exact top-1/top-5 indices. TensorRT FP32 was not promoted
  because tactic selection exceeded the available workspace on this device.
