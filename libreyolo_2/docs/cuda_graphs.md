# CUDA graphs

`predict(..., cuda_graph=True)` replays the forward pass from a captured CUDA
graph instead of launching each kernel individually. It helps most where launch
overhead dominates, so small models at small batch sizes; it does nothing for
work that is already compute bound.

Support is declared per family through the `SUPPORTS_CUDA_GRAPH` class
attribute, which defaults to `False`. Anything that has not opted in raises
`NotImplementedError` rather than falling back silently.

## Why capture is opt-in

A graph records a fixed sequence of kernels along with the memory addresses
they read and write. It does not record values, shapes, or control flow. If a
forward does something the graph cannot encode, replay does not raise: it
returns **wrong numbers silently**. A wrong-but-plausible mAP is worse than
"not supported yet", so families are enabled only after verification.

Three things make a forward uncapturable:

1. **Host-to-device copies.** Building a tensor from Python values inside the
   forward copies from host memory, which capture rejects, even when the
   destination is CUDA. `torch.tensor([w, h], device="cuda")` is a copy.
2. **Stream syncs.** `.item()`, `.cpu()`, `bool(tensor)`, or an `assert` on a
   device tensor forces a sync.
3. **Data-dependent shapes or branches.** A head that emits a variable number
   of elements cannot be a fixed kernel sequence.

Note that NMS and postprocessing are *not* a barrier: capture wraps
`model._forward(x)` only, which ends before postprocessing runs.

## Verifying a new family

Parity is weight-independent, so no checkpoint is needed:

```python
model = LibreSomething(model_path=None, size="s", device="cuda")
model.model.eval()          # see the trap below, this is mandatory
```

Capture at a fixed shape, then replay against **two different inputs** and
require every output tensor to match eager exactly. Check first that at least
one output differs between the two probes, otherwise parity proves nothing: a
graph ignoring its input would match just as well. Then assert the converse
too, that the first replay does *not* match the second probe's eager result,
which is what a stale graph would produce.

Bitwise is the right test for that, not a magnitude threshold. Several
detection heads add a large constant grid to their predictions, so a genuine
input-dependent signal can measure ~1e-7 relative to the output's scale while
being exactly what a stale replay gets wrong. An earlier version of this file
required relative variation above 1e-3 and wrongly demoted three healthy
families on that basis.

Probe with contrasting distributions rather than two uniform draws, which wash
out through global pooling and can leave a head emitting byte-identical output
for both. Add the family to
`tests/e2e/test_cuda_graph_families.py` and set `SUPPORTS_CUDA_GRAPH = True`.
That file lives under `tests/e2e/` because it carries the `general_nightly`
marker, and the nightly target collects with `find tests/e2e -name 'test_*.py'`.
A `general_nightly` test placed under `tests/unit/` is collected by no CI tier
at all: the PR gate filters on `-m unit`, and the nightly never looks there.

Traps that have each produced a wrong answer in practice:

- `model_path=None` leaves the network in **train mode**, and several families
  take a CPU-building branch while training. `predict()` runs in eval, so
  probing without `.eval()` measures a path users never hit.
- The first output tensor is an **anchor grid** for several families and does
  not depend on the input, so a replay that ignored its input entirely would
  still match on it. Check input dependence across all outputs.
- Judging input dependence by **relative magnitude is wrong**. `LibreYOLOX`,
  `LibreEfficientNetV2` and `LibreYOLO7` measure 1e-7 to 1e-5 that way, but
  their outputs still differ bitwise between probes, which is all a bitwise
  parity check needs to catch a stale replay. Assert bitwise difference.
- Seed before constructing. Unseeded draws pass or fail by luck, which is how
  the weak-signal families looked verified for two full runs.
- A **failed capture can poison the CUDA context** for the rest of the process
  ("Offset increment outside graph capture encountered unexpectedly"). Probe
  each family in its own process, or one failure cascades into false negatives
  for everything after it.

## Not supported, and why

| Family | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `l2cs` (gaze) | Out of scope. |
| `sensenova` | Outside this mechanism on two independent counts, neither of them hardware. Its `_forward` takes a structured inputs object rather than a tensor, and inference is autoregressive generation over a growing KV cache, so sequence length changes every decode step. Its vision tower is no better: `bagel.py:264` feeds packed variable-length tokens with `cu_seqlens`, and the line above it calls `torch.max(...).item()`, which syncs. A stock fixed-shape `SiglipVisionModel` does capture bit-identically, but that is not the path this model takes. Supporting it means a static-shape design with graphs bucketed by length, which is a separate feature. It is also not constructible here: no random-init path and a ~15 GB checkpoint. |

The SAM family is supported through a family-specific path too. Its entry
point is `set_image()` / `predict(points=)`, and the image encoder is both the
dominant cost and a single fixed-size tensor in, so that is the unit captured:
encode once, prompt many times against the cached result. Prompt encoding and
mask decoding stay eager, being cheap and varying per click.

This one needs a shim. Upstream `SamVisionAttention.get_rel_pos` builds its
relative-position index with `torch.arange` on the host and then indexes a GPU
tensor with it, which capture rejects. `models/sam/transformers_compat.py`
replaces the method with one that builds the same index on the embedding's
device and memoises it per `(q_size, k_size, device)`. Values are identical,
verified against the upstream computation. The patch installs on import of
`libreyolo.models.sam` and declines quietly if a future transformers release
restructures the method, in which case SAM keeps working and stays eager.

`depth_anything3` splits its forward instead. The sky-to-far-depth step
branches on tensor values and selects a data-dependent number of pixels, so it
cannot be recorded; the network in front of it can. Capture stops at the raw
head outputs and the sky step runs eagerly on the replayed result, which leaves
the numbers identical to the fully eager path. Because that tail lives outside
the graph, the class sets `GRAPH_DISPATCH_IN_FORWARD`, which tells
`forward_maybe_graphed` to route through `_forward` rather than calling the
runner directly. Without that flag the shared helper returns the partial
network output and silently skips the tail.

`birefnet` splits the same way, for a different reason. Its decoder's
deformable ASPP blocks call `torchvision.ops.deform_conv2d`, whose CUDA kernel
replays to a different result under capture. That was reproduced on a bare call
outside any model, under the same side-stream warmup and graph pool the runner
uses, so it is the op and not the harness; being a compiled extension there is
nothing to shim from here. The encoder ahead of it captures bit-identically and
is the bulk of the work, so `forward_enc` is captured and `forward_dec` runs
eagerly on the replayed features. Swapping the kernel for a pure-PyTorch
equivalent was rejected as the alternative: it would not match the fused kernel
bit for bit, so it would shift the model's predictions in the eager path too.

`eomt` needed only that its attention-mask schedule stay on the host. Upstream
tests `attn_mask_probs[i] > 0` and `prob < 1`; both compare a tensor against a
Python scalar, which syncs the stream on a device tensor whether or not the
guarded branch runs. `LibreEoMTNet._apply` keeps that buffer on the CPU across
device moves. It is read only as a scalar, so nothing else changes, and it
stays a registered buffer so checkpoints are unaffected.

`ppocr` is supported through a family-specific path rather than the shared
one. Its `_forward` hook stays unimplemented by design, so the class overrides
`_get_graph_runner` to wrap the detection stage and exposes `forward_det`,
which the pipeline in `models/ppocr/inference.py` calls. Recognition stays
eager on purpose: it runs on text crops whose width varies per line, so a
shape-keyed cache would evict constantly and cost more in capture than replay
returns. Detection input size follows the source aspect ratio, so mixed images
produce several graphs; the runner's cache cap bounds that and falls back to
eager past it.

`rfdetr` is verified on `detect`, `segment` and `pose`. Its `obb` task is not,
because constructing it requires real checkpoint weights rather than random
init; the class-level flag covers it regardless.

`birefnet` was narrowed by bisecting submodule by submodule: the backbone
captures bit-identically, `squeeze_module` does not, inside it the deformable
ASPP branch is the one that drifts, and the op underneath is
`torchvision.ops.deform_conv2d`. TF32, cuDNN autotuning, model state mutated
by capture, and uninitialized allocations in our own code were each ruled out
first. Note the failure mode: replay is deterministic and looks plausible, it
is simply wrong. That is precisely the silent-wrongness this gate exists to
prevent, so the family stays off.


## Interaction with hub MSDA kernels

The DETR-lineage families route multi-scale deformable attention through the
optional compiled Hub kernel when `libreyolo[hub-kernels]` is installed
(Linux, CUDA fp32 eager; see `docs/kernels.md`). Capture then records whatever
the slot resolves to: warmup and replay take the same path, so parity stays
self-consistent either way, but the capture-safety of the compiled kernel
itself has not been verified — the parity suite ran on a machine where the
`kernels` package does not install, i.e. against the portable `grid_sample`
path. The first person to run a DETR family with both `cuda_graph=True` and
hub kernels active should confirm `graph_info()["graph_count"]` becomes
non-zero and outputs match an eager run; `LIBREYOLO_HUB_KERNELS=0` isolates
the kernel if capture fails or drifts.

## sensenova: vision tower graphed, generation eager

Only the vision tower is graphable here. Generation is autoregressive over a
growing KV cache (`NaiveCache`, `forward_cache_update_text/vae/vit`), so its
shapes change every decode step and no fixed graph can represent it. Graphing
that would need a static KV cache with graphs bucketed by length, which is a
separate feature and is not attempted.

The tower is reached through `Bagel.run_vit`, not a `_forward` hook, because
this family's `_forward` takes a structured inputs object rather than a tensor.
`LibreSenseNovaVision.cuda_graph_scope` attaches the runner to the Bagel module
for the duration of a scope and detaches it afterwards, so with graphs off the
call path is byte-for-byte the original.

The tower previously could not be captured at all, even at a fixed token count:
the attention fallback read `cu_seqlens` element by element with `int()`,
syncing the stream once per segment per layer. Those boundaries are now read on
the eager warmup and reused during capture (`_segment_bounds`), which is sound
because a graph is keyed to one shape, so the packing behind it cannot differ
between warmup and replay. That fix is verified: see
`test_sensenova_vision_tower_captures`, which builds the tower from a synthetic
config and needs no checkpoint.

`capture_graph(imgsz=...)` raises for this family by design. The tower consumes
packed tokens whose count depends on the image and the patching config, so
there is no dummy to build from an image size; pass `cuda_graph=True` to
`predict`, which captures lazily at the packed shape.

**Caveat, stated plainly.** The tower's capture-safety is verified, but the
dispatch that reaches it has never been executed: it was written on a machine
that could not hold the ~15 GB checkpoint. Every failure path in `run_vit`
falls back to the eager call and logs at debug level, so a mistake there
degrades to the previous behaviour rather than breaking inference. The first
person to run this family with `cuda_graph=True` should confirm
`graph_info()["graph_count"]` becomes non-zero and that outputs match an eager
run; if it silently stays on the eager path, that is the wiring, not the tower.
