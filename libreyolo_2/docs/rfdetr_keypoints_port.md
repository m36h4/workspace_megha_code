# RF-DETR keypoints: adopting the official (Roboflow v1.8.0) architecture + weights

Status: in progress · Tracking: issue #346 (keypoints/pose for YOLO9 and RF-DETR)

## Why this replaces the previous RF-DETR pose head

The previous RF-DETR pose support in LibreYOLO was a clean-room "pose-as-instance" head
(`keypoint_head = MLP(hidden, hidden, K*3, 3)`, 3 channels/keypoint) written before any official
RF-DETR keypoint model existed. It had no public pretrained weights and could only be trained from
the detection backbone.

On 2026-06-16 Roboflow shipped **official RF-DETR keypoints** (v1.8.0) under **Apache-2.0 for both
code and weights**: `rf-detr-keypoint-preview-xlarge.pth`, COCO person 17-keypoint, **71.8 AP50:95**,
which their benchmark reports as ahead of the leading AGPL-3.0 pose models at comparable latency.
A permissively licensed, strong, AGPL-free pose model is exactly the "match then leapfrog, permissive
license is the wedge" play, so LibreYOLO adopts it.

The official model is a **GroupPose-style** architecture (not a simple per-query MLP), so its weights
cannot load into the old clean-room head. Adopting the weights therefore means porting the official
keypoint architecture and **removing the old clean-room RF-DETR pose head**.

## Feasibility: the detection trunk already matches upstream 1:1

LibreYOLO's `libreyolo/models/rfdetr` is a near-verbatim port of the standard RF-DETR detection
trunk. The shared trunk is **identical in module structure, attribute names, and math** to upstream:
DINOv2 windowed backbone (`backbone.0.encoder.*`), `MultiScaleProjector` (`backbone.0.projector.*`),
`MSDeformAttn` (`sampling_offsets/attention_weights/value_proj/output_proj`), the transformer decoder
layers, `class_embed`/`bbox_embed`, and the Group-DETR `refpoint_embed`/`query_feat` packing. Standard
RF-DETR detection checkpoints already load as-is. This means the **same keypoint weights load into the
same trunk and reproduce the same outputs** once the keypoint-specific modules are added.

## What must be added (the port surface)

1. Dual projector: `backbone.0.cross_attn_projector.*`, a second `MultiScaleProjector`, gated on
   `dual_projector=True` (`dual_projector_kp_only=True` in the preview config: keypoint-only branch).
2. Keypoint head: `keypoint_embed = MLP(hidden, hidden, 8, 3)` (8 channels/keypoint:
   x, y, findable logit, visible logit, 3 precision-Cholesky params, 1 class-logit contribution) plus
   `keypoint_head.keypoint_proj` (vestigial; not consumed, so dropped on conversion).
3. Keypoint decoder token stream (per decoder layer): `kp_inst_self_attn`, `kp_inst_norm`,
   `kp_norm`, `kp_cross_attn` (MSDeformAttn), `kp_cross_attn_norm`, `kp_linear1`/`kp_linear3`,
   `kp_norm5`, `instance_kp_layer_scale`; decoder buffers `keypoint_pos_embed`, `keypoint_class_mask`;
   `ConditionalQueryInitializer` (`keypoint_query_initializer` + `_enc`); two-stage
   `enc_out_keypoint_embed`; `_kp_active_mask` schema buffer.
4. Decode: `xy = delta * ref_wh + ref_xy` (box-relative, no sigmoid); channels 2-7 passthrough;
   the class-logit channel is aggregated into `class_embed`.
5. Postprocess: keypoint topk gather, denormalize to original pixels, `findable.sigmoid()` confidence,
   precision-Cholesky to pixel covariance, uncertainty trace-fusion scoring (`trace_alpha`).
6. Loss / matcher: area-normalized L1 + findable BCE + visible BCE + Gaussian NLL; keypoint costs
   in the Hungarian matcher.
7. Schema / reinit: per-class `num_keypoints_per_class` schema, `reinitialize_keypoint_head` for
   fine-tuning with a different keypoint count.

The trunk modules (backbone encoder, MSDeformAttn, transformer decoder base, queries) are reused
unchanged; only the keypoint additions are ported.

## Exact parity with upstream

The ported model produces the same outputs as the official `RFDETRKeypointPreview` on the same input:
raw `pred_logits`/`pred_boxes`/`pred_keypoints` match to float32 tolerance, and the end-to-end
`predict()` keypoints match to sub-pixel. Golden parity fixtures are committed as tests.

## Class-index note (person-only convention)

The GroupPose schema `[0, 17]` puts the person (keypoint-bearing) class at internal index 1, and the
upstream model emits detection class id 1 for persons. LibreYOLO's person-only pose convention is the
contiguous index 0 (`nc=1`, `names={0: "person"}`; YOLO-pose datasets and the pose validator use class
0). The integration maps the GroupPose internal class to the LibreYOLO contiguous pose label at the
predict/validation/training boundaries, so persons surface as class 0 ("person") while the keypoint
slot is still selected by the internal class. Keypoint coordinates and confidences are unchanged.

## Weights + distribution

The converted checkpoint carries LibreYOLO metadata (`model_family="rfdetr"`, `task="pose"`, `nc`,
`num_keypoints`, `keypoint_dim`, `oks_sigmas`, `names`, `num_keypoints_per_class`) and is published as
`LibreYOLO/LibreRFDETRx-pose` on HuggingFace with explicit Roboflow Apache-2.0 attribution.
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` records the provenance. The checkpoint was converted from
upstream's early-access release.

## Licensing / hygiene

Apache-2.0 (code + weights). Ported files carry a Roboflow provenance header and the
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES` entry records the lineage (same posture as the existing `rfdetr/**` and `ec/**`
ports).
