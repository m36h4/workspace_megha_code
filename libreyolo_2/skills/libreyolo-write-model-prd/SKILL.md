  Write the PRD (port handoff) for adding a new model to LibreYOLO: the
  single markdown document an implementing agent executes end to end. Use when
  someone proposes a model ("should we add X?", "can we port X?", "write a PRD
  for X", "what would it take to add X"), when triaging a model-request issue,
  or when building a batch of candidates for the museum tier. Covers the
  already-in-the-tree check, the license gate, choosing the port source and
  scaffold, preferring training support when practical, the fixed PRD section
  template, and saving the result locally under the user's Documents/handoffs
  directory. Never publish or register the handoff remotely. This is the
  planning half; the execution half is `libreyolo-port-model`.

# Write a PRD for adding a model to LibreYOLO

The deliverable is **one markdown file** that an implementing agent can follow
without further research: what the model is, whether we may legally ship it,
where to port it from, what to clone, what gates to pass, and what will silently
break. If the reader has to go re-derive the license or hunt for a scaffold, the
PRD failed.

This skill does not port anything. When the PRD is approved, the implementer
follows `libreyolo-port-model` (and `libreyolo-upload-hf-model` at the weights
step). Keep the PRD free of process the skills already own: cite the skill
section instead of restating it.

## 1. First question: is it already in the tree?

Do this before any research. It is the cheapest step and the most expensive one
to skip.

```bash
git fetch upstream dev
git ls-tree --name-only upstream/dev:libreyolo/models/
```

**Always inventory `dev`, never a feature branch.** `dev` carries far more
families than any working branch. A campaign that inventoried a feature branch
wrote a complete PRD for YOLOv1, which had already shipped as
`libreyolo/models/yolo1/`, and nearly instructed an agent to create
`libreyolo/models/swin/`, which already exists and holds a shared backbone that
Grounding DINO imports.

Check four things, not one:

1. The family directory (`libreyolo/models/<family>/`).
2. The `FAMILY` id and `FILENAME_PREFIX` you intend to claim, against every
   existing family.
3. The architecture as a **component**. A model can already be in the tree as a
   shared backbone or neck without being a family of its own
   (`git grep -l "<ArchName>" upstream/dev -- libreyolo`).
4. `docs/nomenclature.md` and `weights/LICENSE_NOTICE.txt`, which sometimes
   record a family before or after the code moves.

If it already exists, **stop and write a short note instead of a PRD**: what is
shipped, what is genuinely missing, and the one or two residual tasks worth
doing. Save that note the same way (section 6). A PRD for a shipped model
wastes an entire implementation cycle.

## 2. License gate

Run `libreyolo-license-audit` for the verdict. Do not improvise licensing
judgement here. What this skill adds is what the PRD must *record*.

Two different bars, and collapsing them is the most common error:

- **Code** vendored into core must be MIT, Apache-2.0 or BSD. No GPL, AGPL,
  LGPL, non-commercial or unknown-license code, ever, including rewrites.
- **Weights** only need to be **redistributable**. Non-commercial weights are
  shippable when tagged accordingly. Weights that forbid redistribution are not
  a blocker either: link upstream instead of rehosting (the YOLO-NAS precedent).

Consequences the PRD must state explicitly:

- **A permissive reimplementation rescues a tainted original.** Both original
  FCOS repos open with a non-commercial clause, so neither may be read or
  ported, but torchvision ships a BSD-3 FCOS and that is a clean path. Name the
  source to use *and* the source to stay out of.
- **Never launder.** Rewriting non-permissive code to disguise its origin is
  prohibited regardless of how the result looks.
- **Primary sources only, with evidence URLs in the PRD.** The GitHub license
  API (`https://api.github.com/repos/<org>/<repo>/license`), the raw `LICENSE`
  file, and the HF model card YAML. Never a recollection, never a badge.
- **Say "implied" when it is implied.** Most weights carry no per-artifact
  license and inherit it from the releasing repository. torchvision publishes
  none at all and explicitly disclaims that pretrained models "may have their
  own licenses or terms and conditions derived from the dataset used for
  training". Write that distinction on the model card rather than upgrading an
  inference into a stated grant.
- **Check per-variant, not per-model.** Licenses differ across sizes and
  generations. MiDaS is MIT, but its v2 and v2.1 checkpoints were fine-tuned
  from CC-BY-NC pretraining, so only some variants are clean.
- **Watch the backbone init.** A "trained by us" checkpoint often starts from a
  third-party backbone whose license still applies.
- **Beware the popular decoy.** The most-starred implementation is often the
  unusable one. Name it in the PRD so nobody finds it later and assumes it is
  fine.

## 3. Port source and scaffold

Pick the source that combines permissive code with loadable weights, preferring
the one whose module names match the checkpoints so conversion stays a
metadata-wrap. State the runner-up and why it lost, because the implementer will
otherwise rediscover it.

For the scaffold, read the per-family ledger in `libreyolo-port-model`
(its section 4) and name a concrete directory to clone. Then check the
identifiers you are claiming do not collide, and list the families whose
`can_load` could steal your checkpoints, so the PRD can require bidirectional
rejection tests.

## 4. Scope and evidence

Say which tasks are in scope and declare `SUPPORTED_TASKS` explicitly. Then pick
an implementation and evidence target from `libreyolo-port-model` section 2.
**Prefer a trainable port whenever practical.** Do not default to inference-only
merely to reduce the first implementation's scope. If a safe, reproducible
fine-tuning path exists, include training support in the handoff's initial
definition of done. Inference-only remains legitimate when a concrete technical,
licensing, data, or compute constraint prevents useful user fine-tuning.

Whether the PRD requires a trainer follows three implementation facts:

1. **Task shape.** The task is closed-set and label-supervised: the user's
   dataset is images plus plain labels the existing pipeline already carries
   (boxes, masks, keypoints, class ids). Prompt-driven, text-conditioned,
   zero-shot and multimodal models (SAM, VLMs, CLIP, open-vocab detectors,
   foundation backbones) do not use the ordinary supervised trainer surface: their
   "training" is web-scale pretraining, not user fine-tuning.
2. **Upstream recipe.** Upstream ships a permissively licensed *fine-tuning*
   implementation (loss, assignment, recipe) that converges on a small dataset
   on a single GPU. A pretraining pipeline needing multi-node or web-scale
   data does not count (Depth Anything V2's teacher-student distillation is
   the precedent: supervised task, no user-facing recipe, inference-only).
3. **Integration feasibility.** LibreYOLO's data pipeline can represent the
   required labels, the necessary training operators can be implemented from
   compatible sources, and a normal user can fine-tune on practical hardware.
   Needing web-scale data, multi-node pretraining, unavailable custom kernels,
   or unsupported annotations fails this gate. Historic or museum status alone
   does not.

All three pass: the PRD requires a trainer, includes training in the definition
of done, and states the completed checks and remaining validation work. If
delivery must be staged, make training a named second milestone in the same
handoff rather than an unspecified optional follow-up. Splitting it into a
separate handoff requires an explicit maintainer decision. Any gate fails:
inference-only, and the PRD names the failed gate, the supporting evidence, and
what would need to change for training to become feasible. Genuinely unsure:
write "implementation scope: maintainer call" in the PRD and ask, instead of
guessing.

The one-line intuition: ship a trainer when a real user could run
`model.train(data="their_small_dataset.yaml")` on one GPU and expect a better
model; ship inference-only when "training" really means "pretraining nobody
can reproduce".

Also name the **coverage group** the family enters (`MODEL_GROUPS` in
`libreyolo/models/registry.py`; semantics in `docs/nomenclature.md`, "Model
groups"). Group membership mirrors the implemented surface and selects
cross-family tests; it never grants or removes a capability. The implementer
copies the selected group into the registry at commit 1, and
`tests/unit/test_model_registry.py` blocks merge until they do.

## 5. The PRD document

Use these sections, in this order. It is the shape that has survived adversarial
review, and a consistent shape is what lets an implementing agent trust it.

```
# Handoff: add <MODEL> as a LibreYOLO <task> family

**For:** an implementing agent starting fresh.
**Process authority:** skills/libreyolo-port-model/SKILL.md.

## 0. Mandatory gates          (the non-negotiables, see below)
## 1. The model                (architecture, variants/sizes, historic significance)
## 2. License                  (verdict + evidence URLs + rehost-or-link decision)
## 3. Why we did not add it before
## 4. Why we are adding it now
## 5. Head start already in-tree (closest scaffold, and its traps)
## 6. Scope and evidence
## 7. Implementation pointers  (family id, can_load, converter, export contract)
## 8. Definition of done       (checklist mirroring section 0)
```

Section 0 always carries these gates:

1. **Upstream parity**: `max_abs_diff == 0.0` in eval mode against the
   recommended source, for every shipped size, before any postprocess, export or
   trainer code exists. If the port vendors the same implementation it compares
   against, that check is tautological: say so and give a meaningful alternative
   (published metric reproduction, or parity against the reference the weights
   came from).
2. **Export parity**, separately: the exported graph must match our PyTorch
   output on the same image. "The export runs" is not the bar (see section 7).
3. **Weights**: rehost per `libreyolo-upload-hf-model` when redistributable, or
   link upstream when not. Verify auto-download on a cleared cache.
4. **Tests**: the right registration for the task (see section 7).
5. **UI smoke check**: load one converted checkpoint through the UI and confirm
   predict renders.
6. **Training decision**: when all three training gates in section 4 pass,
   include a trainer and its convergence evidence in the definition of done.
   Otherwise name the failed gate and evidence instead of silently scoping
   training out.

Close with the branch rule: branch off `dev` and land the work through
`merge-to-dev`. An agent may open the PR but never approves or merges it. The PR
body must contain a filled `## Code provenance` section, which
`provenance-check.yml` enforces by matching a `^#{1,6}\s*code provenance$`
heading and failing when it is missing or empty.

Style: no em dashes or en dashes, no personal names, no machine-specific paths.
State only what you verified, and tell the implementer to verify at port time
where you could not.

## 6. Save locally

A model-port handoff is a local working artifact, not a public artifact.

1. Resolve the current user's Documents directory. On Windows, prefer the
   operating system's `MyDocuments` location. On other platforms, use the
   configured documents directory or fall back to `~/Documents`.
2. Create a `handoffs` directory inside it when needed.
3. Save the document as
   `<Documents>/handoffs/HANDOFF_<family>_<task>.md`, using lowercase family and
   task slugs with underscores only where separators are needed.
4. Keep the handoff outside every repository worktree so it cannot be staged or
   committed accidentally.
5. Never upload the handoff as a Gist, publish it through another remote
   service, or edit a GitHub issue or pull request to register it.
6. Before saving, scan for leakage: no credentials, real names, usernames,
   email addresses, or machine-specific paths inside the document. Use
   repository-relative paths in the handoff body.
7. Return the absolute local file path to the user. Do not return or create a
   public URL.

## 7. Facts PRD authors get wrong

Verified against `dev`. Each of these has already shipped in a PRD and had to be
corrected.

- **`from_pretrained` does not exist.** `LibreYOLO` is a factory *function*
  (`libreyolo/models/__init__.py`) that takes a path. The auto-download check is
  `LibreYOLO("Libre<Family><size>.pt")` on a cleared cache with no staged copy
  under `weights/`. Do not write a `from_pretrained` call into a PRD; the bare
  canonical filename is the download trigger.
- **A non-YOLO-grid export needs two backend edits, not one.**
  `_is_nms_free_family()` is a module-level function in
  `libreyolo/backends/base.py` (not a `BaseBackend` method) and only decides
  whether NMS is re-applied *after* parsing. The parse itself is family
  dispatched in `_parse_outputs`, whose final `else` falls through to
  `_parse_yolo9` and reads the graph as a `(4+nc, N)` YOLO tensor. A DETR-shaped
  graph parsed that way returns garbage while appearing to export fine. Route to
  `_parse_dfine` like the shipped DETR families. Never cite line numbers for
  either: they move between branches.
- **`MODEL_CATALOG` is detect-only.** It drives `test_val_coco128.py` and its
  mAP50-95 gate, so a classify, depth or semantic-segmentation row fails by
  construction. Point those families at a per-family unit suite instead, and
  check what the closest merged family actually registers before writing the
  gate.
- **Historic model, modern artifact.** For older models the cleanly licensed
  implementation is often not the historic one: torchvision's AlexNet is the
  "one weird trick" variant, its VGG weights were trained from scratch rather
  than converted from the original release, and its FCN has no skip fusion. Ship
  the modern rebuild if you like, but require the PRD to say so plainly on the
  model card rather than exhibiting a replica under a historic name.
- **Weight hosting rots.** Checkpoints living only on Google Drive or a personal
  academic host need rehosting early in the port, not at the end.
