# Upload a LibreYOLO dataset repo to HuggingFace

Use this skill when publishing a dataset to `https://huggingface.co/datasets/LibreYOLO/<repo>`.

Scope: **data repos** consumed by `model.train(...)` / `model.val(...)` — a single
`.zip` (or a `download:` script) in a LibreYOLO-supported layout. The companion
skill `libreyolo-upload-hf-model` covers weights.

## The golden rule

**Never redistribute a third party's *packaged* artifact** — their `.zip`,
their tarball, their weights. Even when the underlying data is permissively
licensed, *their repackaging* may carry a license they attached, and mirroring
their file is redistributing *their* artifact.

Instead: **rebuild from the canonical upstream** and publish your own artifact
with pinned provenance. `scripts/build_imagenette.py` is the reference example —
it pulls fast.ai's Apache-2.0 tarball, pins its `sha256`, repackages to a
LibreYOLO-layout `.zip`, and uploads. Copy that shape.

## The redistribution license gate (do this FIRST)

Before downloading or hosting anything, establish the **source** license and
decide. This gate is the whole point of the skill — the bug it prevents is
someone wiring `data="foo"` to a URL nobody checked.

| Source license | Host under LibreYOLO? |
|---|---|
| Apache-2.0, MIT, BSD, CC0, CC-BY, PDDL | **Yes** — with attribution in the card |
| CC-BY-SA, ODbL (share-alike) | Yes, but the derivative inherits share-alike — note it, ask if unsure |
| CC-BY-**NC** and any `-NC` variant | **No** — non-commercial conflicts with LibreYOLO's use; substitute or gate, ask the user |
| ImageNet, "research only", custom EULA | **No** — not cleanly redistributable; find a clean substitute |
| GPL/AGPL data, unknown, or no license | **Stop, ask the user** — treat "no license" as all-rights-reserved |

Worked precedent: `imagenet10` (ImageNet-derived → not redistributable) was
**replaced** by `smoke10`, a subset of Apache-2.0 Imagenette. When the license
fails the gate, substitute a clean-sourced equivalent; do not host it anyway.

## LibreYOLO format by task

The dataset must be in the layout the loader expects for its task. Full spec:
`docs/dataset_schema.md` and the loaders under `libreyolo/data/`. Summary:

| Task | Layout | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Detection | `images/**` + `labels/**.txt` (YOLO TXT), **or** COCO JSON | `<class> <cx> <cy> <w> <h>`, normalized |
| Instance segmentation | polygon `.txt`, **or** COCO JSON | COCO keeps holes/multi-part + RLE; YOLO TXT is one ring per instance |
| OBB | rotated-box `.txt` (`<class> x1 y1 … x4 y4`), **or** COCO JSON | 8 normalized corner coords |
| Pose | YOLO TXT + `kpt_shape` / `flip_idx` in the yaml | box then K keypoints; COCO keypoints JSON has **no** `annotations:` path — convert offline (see below) |
| Semantic segmentation | `images/**` + `masks_dir/**.png` | single-channel class-ID PNG, `255`=ignore; optional `label_mapping` |
| Depth | `images/**` + `depths_dir/**` | 16-bit PNG (`depth_scale`, default 256) or `.npy`; `0`=invalid |
| Restore | `inputs/**` + `targets/**` (paired RGB) | matching stems; `input_dir`/`target_dir` in the yaml; `nc: 1`, `names: {0: image}` placeholders |
| Classification | ImageFolder `train/<class>/*`, `val/<class>/*` | class = sorted folder name |

Only **detection, instance segmentation, and OBB** accept native COCO JSON via
an `annotations:` block (`docs/dataset_schema.md`). Pose, semantic, depth, and
restore have no COCO-JSON loader path — convert to their native layout offline.

**Converting into these** (target on the right):
- COCO JSON for **detection / instance-seg / OBB** → keep it; wire with an `annotations:` block (no conversion).
- COCO **keypoints** JSON → there is no `annotations:` path for pose; convert offline to YOLO-pose TXT with `libreyolo.data.convert_coco_keypoints_json_to_yolo_pose` (or `convert_coco_keypoints_splits` for train+val at once), then ship the resulting `labels/` tree.
- A competitor's YOLO-TXT export → already compatible (`data.yaml` + `labels/`).
- Roboflow → export as YOLO **or** COCO; both load.
- Raw class masks → single-channel PNGs under `masks_dir`; remap source IDs with `label_mapping`.
- Paired degraded/clean images (restore) → `inputs/**` + `targets/**` with matching stems.
- Folder of labelled images → ImageFolder `train/val/<class>`.

## The dataset-repo contract

A dataset repo contains the artifact plus a card. No bare zips.

```
<repo>/
├── README.md                # dataset card: frontmatter + Provenance / Contents / Use / License
└── <name>.zip               # the data in LibreYOLO layout (or split .zips)
```

Large sets may ship split archives; keep the card + a manifest. Do not upload
the raw upstream tarball alongside the rebuilt zip.

## Dataset card template

Frontmatter keys are HF dataset-card standard. `license` is the **source**
license (see the gate). Body sections below the `---`:

```
---
license: apache-2.0
task_categories:
  - image-classification        # object-detection / image-segmentation /
                                # keypoint-detection / depth-estimation /
                                # image-to-image (restore)
tags:
  - libreyolo
  - <dataset-tag>
pretty_name: <Pretty Name> (LibreYOLO)
size_categories:
  - 10K<n<100K
---
```

**`license:` is mandatory — never publish a card without it.** It is the source
license the gate resolved; if you cannot name one, you have not passed the gate,
so stop and ask rather than upload. The guard tests check *hosting* only, not
the license field, so this rule is enforced by you, not by CI. A license-less
repo shows as "unknown" on HF and downstream users cannot tell whether the data
is safe to train a shippable model on.

- **# `<Pretty Name>` (LibreYOLO)** — one sentence: what it is, which task, why hosted.
- **## Provenance** — source URL + org + license; pinned source `sha256`; the
  transform applied (e.g. "extracted `.tgz` → `.zip`", "converted COCO → YOLO TXT");
  the line "No third-party repackaging used."
- **## Contents** — the layout and per-split counts; class list or class count.
- **## Use with LibreYOLO** — a short snippet, e.g.:

      from libreyolo import LibreYOLO
      model = LibreYOLO("<checkpoint>")
      model.val(data="<name>")      # auto-downloads this dataset

- **## License** — the source license, inherited, with attribution.

## Wiring auto-download

Two mechanisms — pick by task:

1. **YAML datasets** (detection / segment / obb / pose / semantic / depth /
   restore) — `libreyolo/config/datasets/<name>.yaml` with a `download:`:
   - a **single URL** to the HF zip → auto-downloads on first use, OR
   - a `download: |` Python script (multi-line) for multi-step fetch/convert —
     runs only under `allow_download_scripts=True`. Scripts must
     `from libreyolo.data.utils import download` and pull from
     `huggingface.co/datasets/LibreYOLO/...` or official sources
     (`cocodataset.org`) — **never** a competitor host.
2. **Classification known-names** — add to `_KNOWN_DATASETS` in
   `libreyolo/data/classify_dataset.py`, value = the HF `resolve/main/<name>.zip`
   URL.

**Name is the cache key — new content needs a new name.** Both resolvers cache
by name (classify under `DATASETS_DIR/<name>`, yaml under the dataset dir) and
check that cache *before* the URL, so re-pointing a name already in the wild at
a different artifact silently keeps serving the old bytes to everyone who
downloaded once. When the data changes, publish under a **new** name (as
`imagenet10` → `smoke10` did) or a version suffix (`<name>-v2`); never swap the
artifact behind a name in use.

Both are guarded:
- `tests/unit/test_data_utils.py::test_builtin_dataset_yamls_do_not_use_ultralytics_assets`
- `tests/unit/test_data_utils.py::test_known_classify_datasets_are_libre_hosted`

Run them after wiring; they must stay green.

## Upload workflow

1. **License gate** (section above). If it fails: substitute a clean source or stop and ask.
2. Fetch the canonical upstream and **pin its `sha256`** (reproducibility + tamper check).
3. Convert to the LibreYOLO layout for the task; verify counts and a few samples.
4. Zip with `ZIP_STORED` (images are already compressed — deflate wastes CPU for ~0 gain).
5. Write the dataset card (provenance + license). **Confirm the `license:`
   frontmatter field is present and non-empty before uploading** — it is
   mandatory and unenforced by CI.
6. Create + upload with `huggingface_hub` (`repo_type="dataset"`), token from env
   only (`HF_TOKEN`), never committed:

   ```python
   from huggingface_hub import HfApi
   api = HfApi(token=os.environ["HF_TOKEN"])
   api.create_repo("LibreYOLO/<name>", repo_type="dataset", private=False, exist_ok=True)
   api.upload_file(path_or_fileobj=card.encode(), path_in_repo="README.md",
                   repo_id="LibreYOLO/<name>", repo_type="dataset")
   api.upload_file(path_or_fileobj="<name>.zip", path_in_repo="<name>.zip",
                   repo_id="LibreYOLO/<name>", repo_type="dataset")
   ```
7. **Verify the resolve URL serves real bytes**, not an LFS pointer:
   `https://huggingface.co/datasets/LibreYOLO/<name>/resolve/main/<name>.zip`
8. Wire auto-download (section above) and run the guard tests.
9. End-to-end check: `resolve_classify_data("<name>")` (classify) or
   `model.val(data="<name>.yaml")` (yaml) on a cleared cache.

Prefer a committed build script (like `scripts/build_imagenette.py`) over
one-off commands, so the artifact is reproducible from source.

## Ask the user when

- The source license is CC-BY-NC, research-only, unknown, or absent.
- There is no pinnable upstream version/commit (reproducibility needs it).
- The data contains faces / PII / sensitive content (privacy layers on top of license).
- The dataset is large (multi-GB) — hosting + egress cost is a decision.
- A dataset repo with that name already exists (overwrite is destructive).
- No supported layout fits the task cleanly.

## Common traps

- **Mirroring a competitor's packaged zip** — the exact bug this skill exists to prevent. Rebuild from upstream.
- Re-hosting ImageNet-derived data (redistribution restricted) — substitute Imagenette (Apache-2.0).
- CC-BY-NC data in a commercially-usable project — the `-NC` blocks it.
- Not pinning the source `sha256` — a silent upstream re-cut changes the data under you.
- Zipping already-JPEG images with deflate — use `ZIP_STORED`.
- Renaming class folders — class index is the **sorted folder name**; reordering changes label IDs. Keep upstream naming or document the mapping.
- Uploading without a card / license — HF flags "no license" and users can't tell if it is safe to use.
- Re-pointing an existing dataset name at new content — the resolver caches by name and checks the cache *before* the URL, so everyone who already downloaded keeps the old bytes forever. Ship changed data under a new name or version suffix (see "Wiring auto-download").
- Assuming pose/semantic/depth/restore load COCO JSON — only detection, instance-seg, and OBB have an `annotations:` path; the rest need offline conversion to their native layout.
- Pointing the classify resolver at a `.tgz` — it extracts `.zip` only; convert first (yaml `download:` scripts can handle either via the `download()` helper).
