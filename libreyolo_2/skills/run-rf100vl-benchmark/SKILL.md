# Run the RF100-VL benchmark

RF100-VL: 100 real-world detection datasets from Roboflow Universe (164,149
images, 564 classes, 7 domains), paper arXiv 2505.20612 (NeurIPS 2025
Datasets and Benchmarks). Each dataset ships fixed `train`/`valid`/`test`
splits in COCO JSON. There is no official runner; the harness referenced
below is the runner.

Exact install/launch commands: harness
`docs/rf100vl-operator-runbook.md`. Vast rental mechanics (2FA/TOTP, launch,
destroy): `skills/launch-serverless-gpu-job` (Vast section) or the personal
`vast-launch` skill. This skill is the protocol plus the operational
knowledge those two do not cover.

## Protocol (locked decisions)

| Decision | Value | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| Scoring | pycocotools, `maxDets=500`, per-dataset `test` split | paper |
| Headline metric | AP 0.50:0.95, unweighted mean over the 100 datasets | paper |
| Per-domain means | published alongside (7 domains) | our addition |
| Split discipline | train on `train`, select on `valid`, report on `test` | Roboflow reference code |
| Selection | validate every epoch, EMA weights, keep best AP50:95 | Roboflow reference code |
| Epoch budget | fixed 100, early stopping DISABLED (`patience: 0`) | Roboflow reference code; the harness enforces it |
| Effective batch | 16 (physical batch x gradient accumulation) | Roboflow reference code |
| Precision | fp32; bf16 only via explicit `amp_dtype`; never fp16 autocast | LibreYOLO policy |
| Eval thresholds | conf 0.001; NMS IoU 0.65 for NMS families, identical at selection and final eval; DETR families are NMS-free top-k | LibreYOLO policy |
| Seed | 0 | LibreYOLO policy |
| Recipes | one pinned JSON per family in the harness (`va_bench/recipes/rf100vl/`), sha recorded in every run, same recipe for all 100 datasets | LibreYOLO policy |
| Execution (YOLO) | `cuda_graph: true` and `cache: "disk"` in the recipe protocol when the installed LibreYOLO supports them (bit-identical; covered by recipe hash). Verify capture per family, per commit and per card: see "CUDA graphs and cache" | measured 2026-08 |
| COCO evaluator | faster-coco-eval (Apache-2.0), now the LibreYOLO default; record the backend in artifacts | measured 2026-08 |

Never report toolkit-native trapezoidal mAP; it inflates up to 2.7 AP on
RF100-VL versus pycocotools (paper, App B). LibreYOLO validation is
pycocotools-based already; the 500 cap is the opt-in `eval_max_det` kwarg
(`model.val(data=..., split="test", eval_max_det=500)`). Defaults for normal
users are unchanged (AP at maxDets 100) and test-locked.

**Scoring can cost more than training, and it scales with box density, not
image count.** RF100-VL's `gwhd2021` has 43.6 boxes/image against a median of
4.9; at conf 0.001 and maxDets 500, stock pycocotools spent **496 s/epoch
scoring against 112 s training** — 4.4×, and 6.9 of that dataset's 9.6 h.
faster-coco-eval removes it: verified across all 100 test splits at
max_det=500, **1381/1400 metric values bit-identical, max deviation 2.22e-16
(one float64 ULP), headline mean AP delta exactly 0**, wall 131.4 s → 8.4 s
(15.6× overall, 56× on gwhd2021). The dense outliers to expect are
`gwhd2021`, `recode-waste`, `uavdet-small`. Keep stock pycocotools as the
reference implementation for audit; do not silently swap backends without
recording which one ran.

Validation frequency is protocol-mandated every epoch (gdino
`val_interval=1`; rt-detr / d-fine / lw-detr call `evaluate()` unconditionally,
lw-detr twice). The knob that exists is validation COST (image cache, hoisted
validator, graphed val forward), not frequency. LibreYOLO's own
`TrainConfig.eval_interval` defaults to 10 — a short smoke never validates
unless you pass `eval_interval=1`.

## Where the work happens

Repo `LibreYOLO/vision-analysis-benchmark` (harness branch `rf100vl-harness`).

```bash
# per-dataset fine-tuning: one worker per lane, subprocess children,
# atomic status files, resume, timeouts, dense-dataset OOM fallback
va-bench rf100vl-train --data-dir ./rf100-vl --weights-root ./rf100vl-weights \
  --gpus 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 --jobs-per-gpu 3

# per-dataset test-split eval
va-bench rf100vl --all --data-dir ./rf100-vl --weights-root ./rf100vl-weights

# both plus checks and rendering as ONE resumable command
va-bench rf100vl-campaign --model yolov9t --data-dir ./rf100-vl \
  --weights-root ./rf100vl-weights --gpus 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 --jobs-per-gpu 3
```

`--jobs-per-gpu` is the biggest throughput lever, **but throughput is not the
makespan**. Size it against the LONGEST dataset, not just VRAM. Measured
2026-08: going 8 → 16 lanes on one box made every lane 1.74× slower (uniform
across all 16 datasets, so it is contention, not any one model) and therefore
*lengthened* the serial long pole, finishing later overall. When one dataset
sets the makespan, packing deeper is strictly harmful. Pack when total work
dominates; do not pack when a single dataset does.

Pin `OMP_NUM_THREADS` (and `MKL_/OPENBLAS_`) whenever you pack. Left unset,
torch takes 64 intra-op + 128 inter-op threads *per process*: 16 lanes gave
~124 threads per dataloader worker, 11,890 threads on 128 cores, and **67.6%
system time with 6% idle** — two thirds of the CPU spent on scheduling, not
work. Pinning to 2 took system time to 7.4%.

CUDA graphs improve packing because they remove host launch contention between
lanes sharing a GPU. They also *add* persistent static buffers, so measure
VRAM with graphs in the configuration you will actually run.

Supporting verbs: `rf100vl-preflight`, `rf100vl-dash` (pass `--data-dir` or
queued datasets show no image counts and the ETA is size-blind),
`rf100vl-report`.

- **Dataset, fast path.** Pull [`LibreYOLO/rf100-vl`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LibreYOLO/rf100-vl):
  100 per-dataset tars + lock files. Prefer `max_workers=32` and stay logged
  in (`HF_TOKEN`) for the authenticated rate limit. Do not cargo-cult
  `huggingface_hub[hf_transfer]` / `HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1` on hub 1.x.
- **Dataset, canonical path.** `--download` wraps the `rf100vl` pip package
  (`ROBOFLOW_API_KEY`); use it to rebuild/verify the HF copy. Licensing is in
  `va_bench/data/rf100vl_licenses.json`.
- Weights: `best.pt` at `<weights_root>/<dataset>/<weight_file>`.
- A capability guard aborts on builds without `eval_max_det`/`amp_dtype`.
  `cuda_graph` / `cache` are reported, not required — missing them runs the
  protocol correctly, just slower.
- Flag lists: harness README / `--help` win over this skill.

## Decisions BEFORE dataset one (one-way doors)

The run signature hashes the recipe. **Any recipe change
(`cuda_graph`, `cache`, epochs, imgsz, …) means a fresh campaign** — banked
checkpoints under the old recipe cannot be resumed. Enabling `cuda_graph`
mid-campaign once orphaned 973 banked epochs.

1. Recipe final? (`va_bench/recipes/rf100vl/*.json`)
2. LibreYOLO commit pinned and *actually* installed?
   `pip install --upgrade` on a git URL **silently no-ops when the version
   string is unchanged** and reports success. Use
   `pip install -q --force-reinstall --no-deps "git+..."`, then prove the
   installed `TrainConfig` has the fields the recipe sets.
3. Vast TOTP seed saved (`~/.config/vastai/vast_totp_seed`)? A 2FA session
   expiring mid-campaign once forced stopping a billing box through an
   unverifiable path.
4. Shakedown done on the current stack? (below)

## Compute: vast.ai (default)

Account setup, 2FA, launch, exec, pull, destroy: follow
`skills/launch-serverless-gpu-job` (Vast section). RF100-VL specifics:

- **Image, tested end to end:**
  `vastai/pytorch:2.11.0-cu128-cuda-12.9-mini-py312-2026-06-15`. Vast's own
  image takes their key-injection path; plain `pytorch/pytorch` sometimes
  leaves sshd rejecting keys. cu128 is required for 5090 (`sm_120`).
  Interpreter: `/venv/main/bin/python`, not bare `python`.
- **Accept or reject in 60 seconds** with harness
  `deploy/vast/accept-box.sh` (GPUs, kernels, matmul, HF, PyPI, disk ≥ 120
  GB free). Destroy duds immediately. **`loading` is essentially unbilled**
  (meter starts at `running`); a wedged 15-minute pull destroyed after
  measured ~$0.02. An older estimate of "~$1 for the host search" overstated
  this by ~10x — the real cost is operator attention. Never nurse a doubtful
  host because destroying it "feels wasteful."
- **Disk allocate ~120 GB without image cache, ~250 GB with
  `cache: "disk"`.** The offer filter "machine has ≥ 300 GB free" and the
  `--disk` you rent are different; disk bills on allocated GB. One campaign
  needs roughly 70 GB (image + pip + 49 GB dataset + weights); disk-cache
  `.npy` sidecars add **~108 GB at 416px and ~159 GB at 640px** (see the disk
  projection above — 640px does not fit 250 GB without purging as you go).
- Workload is **CPU / host-bound**, priced GPU-centric. Measured
  [pre-cache]: 46 ms GPU vs 507 ms CPU per step; 8 cores/lane still ~94%
  CPU-saturated. `pick_box.py`'s old `MIN_CORES_PER_LANE = 3.0` was far too
  low. Weight core count and single-core clock heavily (a 2.6 GHz EPYC 7K62
  lost to a consumer Ryzen). Size cores for epoch 1 (cache fill + all lanes
  cold), not the steady-state average. Prefer high-clock CPUs even if the
  GPU $/hr is slightly higher.
- Primary target: one 8× RTX 5090 interruptible box with strong CPU; pack
  with `--jobs-per-gpu` after a VRAM/lane re-measure. Fallback: several
  1–4× 5090/4090 boxes.
- Offer filter: verified, reliability > 0.99, **≥ 8 vCPU per lane after
  packing**, machine disk ≥ 300 GB free (so 120–250 allocated fits), ≥ 500
  Mbps down, download < 0.01 USD/GB, host driver CUDA 12.8+, distinct
  egress IP from known-bad NATs. Bid 20–30% above minimum.
- Interruptible: outbid pauses the box; disk persists and bills; destroy
  deletes. Harness resumes at dataset (status files) and epoch (`last.pt`)
  level. Sync weights/results off-box at milestones; always pull before
  destroy.
- Local-first: one dataset, then rf20vl pilot, then rent. When the stack
  changes (new LibreYOLO commit, recipe, packing, image), shake out on ONE
  cheap GPU first (~$1).
- **Select on `$/GPU-hour`, not `$/hour`.** Measured 2026-08: 8× RTX 5060 Ti
  (16 GB, 128 cores) at $0.79/hr is **$0.099/GPU-h**; an 8× 5090 box is
  $0.467/GPU-h for perhaps 2.5–3× the throughput. On a host-bound workload the
  cheap many-core box usually wins. Check VRAM separately (see sizing above) —
  16 GB is the constraint that actually rules boxes out.

### Running several boxes at once

Each box is fully independent: the harness has no cross-box coordination, so
"multi-node" is really N single-node campaigns plus your attention. That makes
the failure modes operational, not algorithmic.

- **One chain script per box** (wait → campaign → upload → stop), launched
  detached with `setsid nohup ... < /dev/null &`. Put a **gate at the top** that
  asserts the stack invariant you care about and aborts before spending a
  night — e.g. build the model and assert BN eps, or assert the eval backend.
- **One monitor per box**, and make its filter cover failure, not just
  progress: a monitor that only greps the happy path is silent through a
  crashloop, which looks identical to "still running".
- Crash recovery is genuinely good and does not need you: dataset+epoch level
  resume, atomic status files, per-dataset timeouts, OOM → grad-accum fallback.
  ~300 dataset-runs completed with 0 failures unattended.
- **Silent wrongness is what needs you**, and it scales badly with box count.
  Every serious problem in the 2026-08 campaigns was silent: wrong BN eps,
  uploads skipping checkpoints, disk projections, a bad ETA. Before fanning
  out, make sure each of those has a loud check; otherwise N boxes produce N
  results you must hand-verify anyway.

### What healthy looks like (do not "fix" this)

- Launch/host-bound: [pre-cache] healthy meant GPUs at **9–35% util and
  ~170 W of 575 W** with everything fine. Low GPU numbers are the signature
  of this workload, not a fault. The runbook once claimed 60–100% util as
  healthy; that reading burned an expensive detour.
- **Re-baselined 2026-08 with disk cache + faster eval**: dataload fell to
  **0.2 ms of a 350 ms step**, so the pre-cache "507 ms CPU per step" figure
  no longer describes the loop. Util now runs ~39% mean exclusive and 74–94%
  when packed. Both bands are healthy; read util next to power, and treat a
  *change* against your own shakedown as the signal rather than any absolute
  number.
- `nvidia-smi` util is time-with-a-kernel-resident on the CARD, not die
  occupancy per job. With 3 lanes sharing a GPU the row describes the card.
- Datasets are heterogeneous: **92 to 8,791** train images, **0.31 to 12+
  MP**. Epoch times span ~40×. Longest-first scheduling; one dataset sets
  the makespan.
- Epoch 1 costs 1.3–2.1× a steady epoch [pre-cache]; with post-resize cache
  the ratio **widens** (epoch 1 fills the cache). **Every ETA in the first
  hour is garbage** — do not make money decisions off it. A "16.4 h" ETA
  was once an artifact of averaging epoch 1 into a two-epoch mean.

### Sizing a box: measure VRAM, never predict it

Do not derive VRAM from parameter count or GFLOPs. Measured 2026-08 at 640px,
batch 16: **yolox-s (8.97M) = 6.2 GB/lane, yolov9s (~9M) = 10.8 GB/lane** —
same size, 1.7× apart. Activation memory, cuDNN workspace autotuning,
allocator behaviour and CUDA-graph static buffers all dominate, and none of
them follow parameter count.

Measure instead. It costs about a minute per model:

```bash
libreyolo profile run <data.yaml> --weights <W> --size <s> \
  --imgsz 640 --batch 16 --steps 20 --device 0   # prints "peak VRAM"
```

Run the probe matrix on the target GPU before committing a campaign, and take
~20% headroom. The registry's `params_millions`/`gflops` fields are `0.0` for
most non-flagship specs, so they cannot stand in for this.

Being wrong is survivable but not free: the harness falls back to grad-accum
(keeping effective batch 16) and **restarts that dataset from epoch 0**, so a
bad guess costs throughput and wasted epochs, not correctness.

### Disk: project it, do not eyeball it

Two campaigns nearly died on this. Post-resize cache measured
**~953 KB/image at 640px** and **~660 KB at 416px**, so:

    cache_GB ≈ total_images × bytes_per_image
    RF100-VL (163,151 images): ~159 GB at 640, ~108 GB at 416

That is far above the "~105 GB of sidecars" this skill used to quote. Add the
dataset (~49 GB) and checkpoints (measured 108 MB each for a ~9M-param model,
so ~30-56 GB across 100 datasets) and 640px does **not** fit a 250 GB disk.

Fix: purge each dataset's cache when it completes. The cache is reused across
that dataset's 100 epochs and is dead weight afterwards, so purging on
`state == done` bounds it to the active working set (~54 GB) instead of the
full ~159 GB. Never delete anything but `*.r<W>x<H>.npy`.

### When something looks slow: profile, do not theorize

`libreyolo profile` answers "where is the time going" in under a minute.
An hour of py-spy (blocked by container caps), `ps` aggregation, and
log-timestamp forensics produced a confidently wrong answer that
`libreyolo profile run` corrected in 52 seconds. The campaign should print
a Profile hint next to the Monitor hint; if it does not, still run:

```bash
libreyolo profile run ...      # one profiled training epoch
libreyolo profile phases ...   # train / validation / save split
libreyolo profile what-if ...  # projected gain from a fix
```

High self-CPU on an op like `aten::max` with near-zero self-CUDA usually
marks a GPU→CPU sync absorbing device wait, not a CPU bottleneck in that
op. Total self-CUDA ≪ total self-CPU ⇒ launch-bound (CUDA graphs).

**First check that the GPU counters attached at all.** On a rented box where
CUPTI fails to load, the profiler still prints a full report, but every
device-side number is zero and the VERDICT line is then an artifact rather
than a measurement. Measured 2026-08 on an 8x RTX 5060 Ti box:

```
REAL step 362.3 ms = dataload 0.1 ms + compute 362.3 ms  ->  44.2 img/s
GPU util 0%  (0 ms GPU-busy / 362 ms step)  |  0 kernels/step @ ~0us
>> VERDICT: HOST/LAUNCH-BOUND - GPU only ~0% busy
```

That verdict was wrong: enabling CUDA graphs on the same model and batch
changed the epoch time by nothing. `0 kernels/step` is the tell. When you see
it, ignore the verdict and the "self-CUDA vs self-CPU" rule above, both of
which are derived from the dead counters, and read the per-phase wall table
instead, which is host-side timing and stays valid:

```
phase         gpu_ms  wall_ms  kernels     ops
to_device        0.0      5.9        0       8
forward          0.0    127.9        0    4562
backward         0.0    222.9        0    5093
optimizer        0.0      6.3        0    2800
```

### CUDA graphs and cache: prefer them, then verify both

Keep `cuda_graph: true` and `cache: "disk"` as the default recipe protocol.
Both are perf-only and covered by the recipe hash. Two things to verify
before trusting either, because each has cost a campaign.

**Capture is gated by family and by commit.** At an older pinned LibreYOLO
only `yolo9` and `rfdetr` implemented the training capture hook; every other
family took the eager fallback, so setting the flag did nothing but log a
warning. Current dev covers far more families (`docs/training_cuda_graphs.md`
holds the table and the per-family speedups). Check that table for the commit
you actually pinned, not for `dev`, and confirm the run log says
`cuda_graph: captured training forward/backward at input shape (...)`. Absent
that line, the flag is decorative.

**The speedup is batch-dependent, and can be zero.** The documented gains are
measured at batch 8, where launch overhead is a large share of the step. At
the protocol's batch 16 the same model can show nothing: yolonas-s measured
83.4 / 78.9 s per epoch eager against 83.6 / 78.4 s graphed, with capture
confirmed in the log. yolo9 still gains at batch 16. Measure before assuming.

**Capture inflates VRAM, and `libreyolo profile run` will not show it**
because it does not capture graphs. yolo9-m at 640 and batch 16 profiled at
15721 MB, which looks survivable on a 16 GB card. The real graphed run OOM'd
on **all 100 datasets**, with the failure naming the cause:

```
13.61 GiB allocated in private pools (e.g., CUDA Graphs)
```

Disabling capture on that box dropped the same run to 15207 MB and it trained
fine at full protocol batch. So size the lane with a 2-epoch smoke campaign,
which exercises the real path including capture, EMA and validation:

```bash
va-bench rf100vl-campaign --model <M> --recipe <R> \
  --datasets <one-dataset> --gpus 0 --jobs-per-gpu 1 --smoke-epochs 2
```

For a NMS-family model that cannot hold capture on the target card, dropping
`cuda_graph` is the cheap deviation: the harness treats graph replay as
outside the run signature and bit-identical on loss. Dropping physical batch
is the expensive one, because it changes BatchNorm statistics even though
`nbs` keeps the effective batch at 16.

### Contribute the speedup back

The campaign is a load test of LibreYOLO training, so treat what the profiler
finds as a LibreYOLO bug list rather than a campaign workaround list. The
scoring cost above is the model: it was found by profiling a campaign, fixed
in the library as a default, and now every user benefits. When a fix belongs
in the library, send it there and pin the campaign to the commit that carries
it, rather than carrying a private patch on the box.

### Shakedown (before any full campaign)

1. Rent one cheap high-clock-CPU GPU.
2. Install exactly as the campaign would (`--force-reinstall --no-deps`);
   prove recipe fields exist on the installed `TrainConfig`.
3. Run 2–3 representative datasets (tiny ~100 imgs, huge ~8k, large-image
   12 MP class), 10–15 epochs, `eval_interval=1`, plus one full completion.
4. Kill-and-resume between checkpoints (not mid-write).
5. Record VRAM/lane, cores/lane at epoch 1 and steady state, epoch-1 ratio,
   validation share, healthy util band. Size the real box from those numbers.

### Stopping and resuming

- **Ctrl-C mid-checkpoint can corrupt `last.pt`** and poison resume for that
  dataset. Stop gracefully: `tmux send-keys -t bench C-c`, wait for the
  orchestrator to exit, then `vastai stop instance` if keeping the box.
- A **stopped** box bills disk only; restart needs those exact GPUs still
  free. Decide stop-vs-destroy from disk $/day, re-stage cost (~35 min,
  nearly free bandwidth), and whether banked checkpoints are usable
  (recipe change ⇒ they are not).
- **Stopped is not restartable on demand.** 2026-08 a restart returned
  `resources_unavailable, state change queued` and `intended_status` reverted
  to `stopped`; the GPUs came back only hours later. Treat a stop as
  "possibly forever". **Sync every box-local file you cannot regenerate BEFORE
  stopping** — recipes, chain scripts, any hand-written config. `sync-artifacts`
  does not upload the recipe, and a run whose `recipe_sha256` points at a file
  that exists nowhere is not reproducible.
- Instance ops need a live 2FA session (~7 days) and `ssh<N>.vast.ai` DNS can
  fail transiently. Keep the dashboard tunnel up: an established tunnel
  survives a DNS outage and is the only health channel left when ssh will not
  resolve.
- Destroy ends spend. Always pull/sync first.

## Decisions to take per campaign

1. Model list and sizes. Flagships deep (yolo9 and rfdetr); other families
   start with their one or two smallest variants.
2. Pilot first: `rf20vl` end to end. Graduate to 100 only if all 20 complete,
   kill-and-resume reproduces within noise, and AP ordering is sane.
3. Budget and waves: price from live offers (`deploy/vast/pick_box.py`),
   publish after flagships land, append families as they finish.
4. Recipe deviations: live in the recipe JSON, hash-recorded, disclosed.
   No silent knobs. Finalize before dataset one.

## Artifacts and publishing

Keep, per model: per-dataset eval JSONs, raw predictions (COCO detections),
per-run `stats.json` (recipe sha, best epoch, seed, dataset version, wall
time), the recipe JSON, the dataset version lock, and the final submission
JSON. Predictions are on by default for publishable runs.

- Upload with `va-bench sync-artifacts` to a LibreYOLO HF dataset repo
  (create the repo by hand; fine-grained write token scoped to that repo).
  Pass `--eval-dir` so predictions are collected. Stock-pycocotools rescore
  of a saved dump reproduced harness AP to four decimals with no harness
  code imported.
- **`sync-artifacts` is silent about what it does not upload.** It ships the
  paths it knows (`eval/`, `stats/`, `submissions/`, and `runs/*/weights` when
  the weights root has the `.runs` layout) and ignores everything else, while
  printing a cheerful `uploaded N, skipped 0`. It does **not** ship the recipe
  JSON, nor arbitrary files placed in the weights root, nor checkpoints from a
  flat `<root>/<dataset>/<file>` layout. **Verify after every publish by
  listing the repo** (`HfApi().list_repo_files`), not by reading the uploader's
  log — and note the tree API paginates at 1000 entries, so a raw count there
  silently truncates.
- Leaderboard submission: `vision-analysis` via `submit-benchmark-results`
  (see `benchmark-on-visionanalysis`).
- Never hand-edit result JSONs. Regenerate them.

### Always check: does selection agree with the test score?

The cheapest possible guard, and the one whose absence cost the most. Compare
each run's `valid_mAP50_95` (from `stats.json`) against the published test AP.
For a healthy run they track within noise; a large one-sided gap means the two
paths disagree about the model, not that the model generalises badly.

2026-08: yolox-nano reported valid 0.5663 and test 0.1620 on `ball` while
yolox-tiny agreed to 0.002 on the same datasets. The cause was BatchNorm eps
(models trained at 1e-5, evaluated at 1e-3, ruinous for the depthwise nano
only), fixed in libreyolo #700. A whole 100-dataset campaign published a
headline **0.3601 that should have been 0.4853** and nothing flagged it.

The corollary: a **16-point gap between adjacent sizes of one family is not a
result, it is a bug report.** Adjacent sizes land ~3 points apart.

## Traps

- Stock pycocotools `summarize()` breaks with a non-default maxDets list
  (headline AP becomes -1). Never call it with a modified list.
- Package-cleaned data only. Raw Universe exports keep the dummy class and
  score near zero.
- Dataset named `-grccs`: `--datasets=-grccs` (space form is eaten by argparse).
- Never resume after changing physical batch, accumulation, **or recipe
  fields covered by the run signature** (including `cuda_graph` / `cache`).
- Dense datasets can OOM rfdetr; harness falls back to grad-accum and
  restarts that dataset from epoch 0. Expected.
- ec family: AdamW, no mosaic (mosaic triggers a degenerate-box assertion).
- Largest datasets take hours; raise timeouts for slow families, never remove.
- Differences under 0.5 mAP on the 100-dataset mean are noise. Replicate.
- `ROBOFLOW_API_KEY` and vast credentials: env/local config only. Never commit.

## Published numbers to beat (fully supervised, AP 0.50:0.95)

RF-DETR N/S/M/L/XL/2XL: 57.7 / 60.2 / 61.2 / 62.2 / 62.9 / 63.2. LW-DETR
T to X: 57.1 to 62.1. D-FINE N to X: 58.2 to 62.2. YOLO11 N to X: 55.3 to
