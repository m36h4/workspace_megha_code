"""Per-family adapters onto the ``ms_deform_attn`` op slot.

Two things are checked for every family that was rewired:

1. With the slot active, the family core hands it the classic Deformable-DETR
   layout (a mock implementation records what it received).
2. With the slot inactive - the CPU / no-kernel-installed case, which is the
   default everywhere these tests run - the family core takes its own
   untouched grid_sample path and produces the same attention output as the
   reference classic core.

Together those pin the accelerated path's input contract and prove the
portable path is still the one that runs by default.
