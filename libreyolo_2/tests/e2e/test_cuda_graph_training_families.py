"""Per-family CUDA graph *training* capture, through the real train() API.

The unit suite covers dispatch and gating with fakes. This file runs actual
training runs on a generated dataset and checks the two things a user cares
about:

* capture engages and stays engaged. Every failure mode in this feature
  degrades to eager, silently, so a run that merely completes proves
  nothing; the capture log line has to be asserted. Five families shipped
  with the flag doing literally nothing until this assertion was added.
* enabling the flag does not move the loss trajectory.

The second check adapts to the family rather than assuming determinism: the
eager arm runs twice to measure how far it moves on its own, and the graphed
arm is held to that spread plus a documented per-family ``rel_tol``.
Deformable attention accumulates its backward with atomics and TF32
convolutions pick their reduction order per launch, so several families do
not reproduce their own eager run either, and a fixed band would test that
noise instead of the capture.

No downloads: the datasets are generated and every model is built with
``model_path=None``. Families that pull a pretrained backbone at
construction are marked ``external_data``.
