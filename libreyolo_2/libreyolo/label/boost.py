"""Boost: train-in-the-loop on the labels you've already accepted.

After you've accepted enough boxes, LibreLabel can quietly fine-tune the *head*
of your own (tiny) detector on those labels -- backbone and neck frozen -- and
tell you whether it helped: "model agrees 88% (was 61%)". That delta is the
whole point. It is the difference between *help me make labels* and *the tool is
learning from me*.

Honesty (this is ``REAL_MINIMAL``, not "real training"): a frozen-backbone,
1-2 epoch CPU fine-tune of a few dozen images is a *probe* -- it nudges the head
toward your corrections and measures the agreement shift. Budget a couple of
minutes on a laptop CPU. It runs on a background thread; the UI shows a chip.

Hard invariant (the trust contract): this writes **nothing** to the dataset's
label files. It snapshots the accepted labels into a throwaway temp dataset
(symlinked images + freshly written ``.txt``), trains into a temp dir, and
deletes the whole temp tree when done. Your source labels are never opened for
writing.
