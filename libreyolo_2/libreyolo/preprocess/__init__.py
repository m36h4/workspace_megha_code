"""Torch-free input preprocessing.

Mirrors ``libreyolo/postprocess/``: the family-specific numpy preprocessing
recipes live here rather than under ``libreyolo/models/``, because importing
anything under ``models/`` runs ``models/__init__.py``, which eagerly
constructs every model class to populate the ``can_load()`` registry. Those
classes are ``nn.Module`` subclasses and genuinely require torch, so a backend
that only needs a letterbox recipe would drag the whole torch wheel in with it.

Keeping these functions here is what lets ``backends/base.py`` (and therefore
``backends/onnx.py``) import without torch, so a lightweight deployment can run
ONNX inference with just numpy + onnxruntime.

``libreyolo/models/<family>/utils.py`` re-exports everything here, so existing
import paths keep working.

See https://github.com/LibreYOLO/libreyolo/discussions/711.
