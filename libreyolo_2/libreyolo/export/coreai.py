"""Core AI (``.aimodel``) export.

Core AI is Apple's on-device inference stack, the successor generation to
Core ML. Unlike the Core ML path, which records a single trace through
``torch.jit.trace``, this converter goes through ``torch.export``: a real
graph capture with guards. That is stricter (host scalar reads and
data-dependent control flow are rejected rather than silently baked in) and
removes the need for the static-eval monkey patches the Core ML path carries.

Pipeline::

    torch.export.export -> run_decompositions -> TorchConverter -> optimize
                        -> AIProgram.save_asset(.aimodel)

Artifacts declare ``minimum_os = OSVersion.v27``; that is the only value the
Core AI toolchain offers, and it gates *deployment*, not conversion. Both
conversion and Python-side execution work on earlier macOS through the
runtime shipped inside the ``coreai`` wheel, but numerics differ between OS
versions, so parity must be recorded on macOS 27.

SCOPE: EXPORT, NOT INFERENCE
----------------------------
There is no Core AI entry in ``libreyolo/backends``. This module converts a
model and the support matrix records numeric parity against a reference
artifact, but nothing in the library loads an ``.aimodel`` back for inference
the way ``backends/onnx.py`` loads an ONNX graph. A ``validated`` row here is
a claim that the exported graph computes the same numbers as the reference,
not that ``predict`` will run it. Consumers use the Core AI runtime directly.

OUTPUT ORDERING CONTRACT
------------------------
Core AI returns a **named dict**, and its key order matches neither the eager
forward's tuple order nor anything a caller can guess. Consumers must map by
name. The exported output names are recorded in the artifact metadata under
``coreai_output_names`` so a backend can rebuild the canonical ordering
without re-deriving it. Never pair Core AI outputs with eager outputs
positionally.

    version that returns that Parameter whenever the token count matches.

    It bakes for the backbone's CONFIGURED shape, though, which is 384 for the
    nano size. Export at any other canvas and the token counts no longer match
    (640 needs 40x40 = 1600 patches against the baked 24x24 = 576), so the fast
    path is skipped and the fallback runs a bicubic *with antialiasing* inside
    the traced graph. The converter has no lowering for
    ``aten._upsample_bicubic2d_aa`` and refuses the program.

    Pointing the backbone at the export canvas and re-running its own bake
    moves that interpolation back out of the graph. The numbers are unchanged:
    the eager fallback resizes the baked grid to the canvas with an
    antialiased bicubic, and re-baking performs exactly that resize, just
    ahead of capture instead of during it.

    This is deliberately NOT a general interception of ``F.interpolate``. An
