"""
Distillation loss functions: MGD and CWD.

Both losses are model-agnostic — they operate on pairs of feature tensors
(student, teacher) of shape [N, C, H, W] and handle channel mismatches
internally via 1x1 convolution adapters.

    Aligns the student feature map to the teacher's channel width with a 1x1
    conv, resizes the teacher's feature grid to the student's spatial size
    (bilinear), and minimizes the mean-squared error between them. Unlike
    MGD/CWD this makes no assumption that teacher and student share a spatial
    resolution or stride, so a single-scale foundation teacher (e.g. a DINOv2
    ViT with a /14 patch grid) can supervise a convolutional backbone stage.

    This is the classic feature-distillation objective (FitNets, Romero et al.,
    ICLR 2015): match intermediate student features to a frozen teacher's via
    a learned projection and an L2 loss. The same objective underlies modern
    frozen-SSL-teacher recipes that distill a DINOv2 ViT into a smaller student
    with a plain feature MSE. Implemented from that public description; no
    third-party distillation source was used.

            dimension before the MSE (angle-only matching, scale-invariant).
