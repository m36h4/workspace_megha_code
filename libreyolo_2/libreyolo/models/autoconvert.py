"""Runtime auto-conversion of upstream checkpoints to LibreYOLO format.

LibreYOLO's model families are ported from MIT/Apache upstream projects whose
released checkpoints are *almost* loadable but do not carry LibreYOLO v1.0
metadata (family, size, task, class count, class names). When the factory
meets such a file it calls :func:`autoconvert_upstream_checkpoint`, which:

1. unwraps the tensor dict from the common upstream layouts
   (``ema.module`` / ``ema_state_dict`` / ``ema_net`` / ``net`` / ``model`` /
   ``state_dict`` / plain),
2. asks every registered family — via
   :meth:`BaseModel.convert_upstream_state_dict` — whether it recognizes the
   layout, remapping keys where the upstream naming differs from the native
   port (YOLO9, RT-DETR/v2/v4, PicoDet, RTMDet),
3. wraps the winner in a strict v1.0 metadata checkpoint (size, task and class
   count read from the tensors themselves, so fine-tuned checkpoints convert
   correctly), and
4. writes it beside the source as ``<source>-<Prefix><size>[-task].pt`` and
   returns the new path so the factory can load it normally.

RF-DETR keeps a bespoke recognizer because it needs the full checkpoint (not
just the tensor dict) for size detection and COCO class remapping, and is only
lazily registered when its optional dependencies are installed.

When several families claim one file, a subclass beats its base, then registry
order decides (it encodes specificity). The filename is consulted only for the
DEIM/D-FINE tie — identical tensors that nothing else can separate — which is
refused outright when the name gives no hint.
