"""LibreYOLO1 - YOLOv1 detector (the original 2016 "You Only Look Once"), cfg-driven.

Source provenance: architecture and pretrained weights derive from
pjreddie/darknet, which is public domain (the "YOLO LICENSE": *"Darknet is
public domain. Do whatever you want with it."*). See
``libreyolo/models/darknet/`` for the shared engine and provenance detail.

Sizes:
    ``t`` tiny-yolo v1 (448)   8 conv + 1 fully-connected head
    ``b`` yolo v1      (448)   24 conv + a locally-connected + fully-connected head

Notes: YOLOv1 predates anchor boxes and COCO. It uses a fixed 448x448 input
(the fully-connected head forbids dynamic shapes), a single ``[detection]`` head
that decodes a dense ``S*S*(C + B*(coords+1))`` vector (S=7, B=2, C=20 VOC
classes -> 7x7x30), and it is trained on Pascal VOC (2007+2012), NOT COCO. The
``[connected]`` (fully-connected) weight layout is the load-bearing port detail
(see ``darknet/blocks.py::DarknetConnected`` / ``darknet/reader.py``). This
family is inference-only in LibreYOLO.
