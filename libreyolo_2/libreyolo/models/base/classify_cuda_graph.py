"""CUDA-graph training capture for the plain-softmax classification families.

ResNet, ConvNeXt, MobileNetV4 and EfficientNetV2 share one training step:
``logits = model(imgs)`` followed by ``F.cross_entropy(logits, targets)``.
The forward never reads the labels, so the whole backbone-plus-head is
static-shaped and capturable, and only the cross-entropy stays eager. One
mixin therefore covers the group; per-family trainers just inherit it.

Cross-entropy is cheap next to the backbone, so these families sit at the
favourable end of the capture trade-off: nearly the entire step is inside
the graph.
