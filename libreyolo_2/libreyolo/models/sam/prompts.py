"""Pure prompt-normalization for the LibreSAM tier.

The promptable-segmentation API accepts points and boxes in the flexible,
user-friendly shapes documented for the de-facto standard interface, then
coerces them into the single canonical nesting the underlying processor
expects:

    points -> [point_batch, num_points, 2]   (one entry per object/mask)
    labels -> [point_batch, num_points]
    boxes  -> [num_boxes, 4]

Nesting depth carries meaning, matching the documented public surface:

    points=[x, y]                      one object, one point
    points=[[x, y], [x, y]]            two objects, one point each
    points=[[[x, y], [x, y]]]          one object, two points (grouped)

Everything here is pure (lists in, lists out) so it can be unit-tested fully
offline without torch, transformers, or model weights.
