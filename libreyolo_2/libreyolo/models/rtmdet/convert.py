"""Upstream RTMDet and RTMDet-Ins checkpoint key remapping.

Upstream mm-series RTMDet checkpoints name the detection head ``bbox_head``
where LibreRTMDet uses ``head``, and carry normalization constants under
``data_preprocessor`` that LibreYOLO applies in its own preprocessing. The
remap is purely syntactic; with ``share_conv=True`` upstream stores the same
conv weight at all three pyramid levels, and keeping the redundant entries is
fine — LibreRTMDet's aliased modules overwrite each other with equal values.

Shared by the runtime auto-converter and ``weights/convert_rtmdet_weights.py``.
