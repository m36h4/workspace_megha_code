"""LibreYOLO9P2 inference and training wrapper.

YOLOv9 small-object (P2) variant. Shares the backbone with standard YOLOv9
but surfaces its stride-4 feature map, extends the PAN neck one level down,
and detects on four scales with strides (4, 8, 16, 32) instead of three.

Base YOLOv9 detect checkpoints transfer almost entirely: the backbone and
the existing neck modules load as-is, and the three pretrained head towers
load after an index shift (checkpoint towers 0/1/2 map to P3/P4/P5 slots
1/2/3, leaving the new P2 tower at index 0 freshly initialized).

Color space: RGB 0-1 (same as standard YOLOv9).
Sizes: t / s.
