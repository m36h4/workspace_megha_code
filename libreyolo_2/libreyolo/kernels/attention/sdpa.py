"""Fused scaled-dot-product attention: the shared policy, not a new kernel.

``torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention`` dispatches to the flash,
memory-efficient or cuDNN attention kernels instead of materialising the
``(heads, q, k)`` score matrix. Model families written as
``q @ k.T -> softmax -> @ v`` can hand their attention to it, but two rules
decide *when*:

- **Export never does.** LibreYOLO defaults to ONNX opset 13, which has no
  symbolic for fused SDPA, so every swapped call site keeps the primitive-op
  equation under ``torch.onnx.is_in_onnx_export()``.
- **Byte-exact parity bars keep manual math by default.** Several ports are
  pinned to ``max_abs_diff == 0`` against a reference that itself runs manual
  attention (the Swin and OWLv2 parity harnesses explicitly switch the
  reference's fused path *off* to get that). Fused kernels accumulate in a
  different order, so those families carry ``fused_attn = False`` and only
  switch when a caller opts in with :func:`set_fused_attention`. Families
  whose bar is a tolerance use SDPA by default and carry no flag.

Which family is which is recorded in the module docstring of each rewired
attention class, next to the parity bar it has to meet.

    """Whether a graph capture in progress must see the primitive-op equation.

    Two capture kinds need it:

    - **ONNX export.** LibreYOLO defaults to opset 13, which has no symbolic
      for fused SDPA.
    - **``torch.jit.trace``**, which is how the TorchScript, CoreML and NCNN
      exporters capture. Their artifacts were validated on primitive-op
      graphs, and a traced ``aten::scaled_dot_product_attention`` is a
      different graph for every downstream converter to handle.

    Two capture kinds are deliberately *excluded*:

    - **``torch.compile``** lowers SDPA better than the manual equation, so
      forcing primitives there would deoptimize compiled inference. Neither
      dynamo predicate can single out ``torch.export``: on torch 2.11 both
      ``is_compiling()`` and ``is_exporting()`` are True under plain
      ``torch.compile`` as well, so gating on either would cost the compiled
      path its fused kernels.
    - **``torch.export``** (ExecuTorch, Core AI) therefore stays ungated, and
      does not need the gate: both backends decompose SDPA to core ATen
      before their converter runs, Core AI through ``run_decompositions()``
      and ExecuTorch through ``to_edge_transform_and_lower``.

    The ``ms_deform_attn`` slot does gate on both dynamo predicates, but it
    loses nothing by it: that slot has no compiled-inference story to protect,
    only a runtime-fetched binary to keep out of every captured graph.

    The ``ms_deform_attn`` slot uses a stricter rule (it also refuses under
    ``torch.compiler.is_compiling()``) because it dispatches to a
    runtime-fetched compiled kernel that must never be captured at all. This
    one is stock torch either way, so only the capture formats that care
    about the op spelling are covered.
