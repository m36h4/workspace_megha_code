"""Kernel registry: pluggable accelerated implementations for library ops.

Architecture (vLLM-shaped, scaled down to a library that rents its runtime):

- Op slots are organized by purpose, not backend:
  ``kernels/quant/simulate/`` holds fake-quantization kernels (any device,
  STE backward, run during QAT *and* simulated PTQ/val inference),
  ``kernels/quant/execute/`` holds finalized-only real-precision paths
  (no backward, real hardware), and ``kernels/attention/`` holds attention
  ops shared across model families.
- The reference implementations in ``quant/fake_quant.py`` are always
  registered and always available. They are the numerical oracle: any
  accelerated implementation must match them (parity tests gate in-tree
  kernels, and ``quant/packing.py`` never has variants because it is the
  checkpoint contract).
- Triton kernels are plain Python (JIT compiled at runtime, no build step,
  no wheels) and are imported lazily on first resolution.
- Compiled kernels ship out-of-tree in the optional ``libreyolo-kernels``
  package. If installed, it is imported here and self-registers via
  :func:`register`; the core package never grows a build dependency.
- Hugging Face Hub kernels load through the optional ``kernels`` package
  (the ``libreyolo[hub-kernels]`` extra); installing it is the opt-in, and
  ``LIBREYOLO_HUB_KERNELS=0`` disables it. Absence of the package is the
  normal fallback case.
- Selection is per-op: implementations are tried newest-first and the first
  one whose predicate passes wins, falling back to the reference. The
  ``LIBREYOLO_KERNELS`` environment variable overrides selection:
  ``off``/``reference`` forces the reference implementations; any other
  value selects only implementations registered under that name.
  ``LIBREYOLO_QUANT_KERNELS`` is honored as a legacy alias.

Registered op slots (callables with the reference signatures):
``fake_quant_int8_per_channel``, ``fake_quant_int8_affine``,
``fake_quant_fp8``, ``fake_quant_int_grouped``, ``fake_quant_nvfp4_weight``,
``fake_quant_nvfp4_dynamic``, ``fake_quant_mxfp4_weight``,
``fake_quant_mxfp4_dynamic``, plus the unpack slots ``unpack_int_grouped``
and ``unpack_nvfp4``. GEMM and attention slots (``fp8_gemm``,
``ms_deform_attn``, ``nvfp4_gemm``, ...) have no reference implementation:
callers must check :func:`resolve` returns non-None before use and keep
their portable path as the fallback.
