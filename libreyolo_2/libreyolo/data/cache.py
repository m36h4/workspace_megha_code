"""Optional image caching shared by dataset classes.

Every training epoch re-reads, re-decodes and re-resizes the same image files
from disk. Enabling caching keeps the result of that deterministic work around
so later epochs skip it. There are two cache points, and the dataset picks the
right one per read:

* **Post-resize** (``load_resized_img``): the decoded image after the
  deterministic pre-augmentation resize to ``img_size``. This is the cache
  point for every family whose transform consumes the dataset's resized frame
  (it skips decode *and* resize), and it is the one that makes caching viable
  at all on large-image datasets: a 4000x3000 source stores ~640px pixels,
  roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the decoded original. Because
  augmentation always runs downstream of this resize, the cached pixels are
  augmentation-agnostic and safe to reuse across every epoch — later reads are
  byte-identical to a fresh decode+resize by construction.
* **Pre-resize** (``load_image``): the decoded full-resolution image. This is
  the cache point for transforms that opt into ``wants_unresized_image`` and
  own all resizing themselves (RT-DETR, DEIM, RF-DETR, PicoDet, ...). It skips
  decode only, and stores original-resolution pixels.

The ``cache`` flag accepts:

    False / None  -> disabled (default)
    True / "ram"  -> keep cached images in RAM (per dataset instance)
    "disk"        -> store cached images as ``.npy`` beside each source image

``"disk"`` is process- and platform-safe (each DataLoader worker just reads the
``.npy`` file), so it is the recommended mode when training with workers. RAM
caching benefits single-process loaders (``workers=0``) or loaders with
``persistent_workers=True``; with respawned workers each worker fills its own
copy, which is harmless but yields no cross-epoch reuse.
