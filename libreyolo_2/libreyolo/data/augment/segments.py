"""Ring-list segment-polygon helpers for the numpy pipelines.

Moved verbatim from ``libreyolo/models/yolo9/transforms.py``. Instances are
lists of polygon rings (``(N, 2)`` float arrays), the format produced by the
YOLO datasets.

NOTE: RF-DETR's segment helpers in :mod:`libreyolo.data.augment.rfdetr` use a
different data model (dense-mask-backed rings for crop paths) and are
deliberately NOT merged with these — see the augmentations refactor plan.
