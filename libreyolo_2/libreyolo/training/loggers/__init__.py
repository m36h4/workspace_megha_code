"""Built-in experiment loggers layered on the public training hooks.

Loggers are ordinary training callbacks consuming the public hook system

    model.train(data="data.yaml", loggers="mlflow")

or pass configured instances (mixing with names is fine)::

    from libreyolo.training import MLflowLogger
