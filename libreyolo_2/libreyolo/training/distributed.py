"""Distributed training utilities for LibreYOLO.

Thin helpers around ``torch.distributed`` so the rest of the trainer can stay
backend-agnostic. All helpers degrade to no-ops when distributed is not
initialised — single-GPU code paths continue to work unchanged.

User-facing surface accepts ``device=[0, 1]`` (or ``device="0,1"``) and
launches with ``torchrun --nproc_per_node=N``. Inside each child process
``init_distributed()`` is called by the trainer; outside DDP everything is a

    ``global_count / world_size`` and DDP averaging the gradients, the two

    DDP all-reduces gradients during ``backward()`` and **averages** them

    each rank already produces a "full-batch magnitude" gradient (normalized by
    a per-positive / per-box count — globally reduced for yolo9's ``cls_norm``
    and the DETR ``num_boxes``), so DDP's averaging composes them into the

    over-counts by ~N and inflates the effective learning rate — this was the
    root cause of the multi-GPU accuracy gap in issue #484 (4-GPU trained at
    ~4× LR vs single-GPU).

    This is a CONTRACT each family's loss must satisfy, not a given: a loss

    once the identity is in place. New families must either use a local
    normalizer or the ``all_reduce_avg_scalar`` reduction (global sum /
    world_size) — never a bare global sum.
