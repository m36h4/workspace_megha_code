"""CUDA graph capture for the training-step network forward and backward.

Small and mid-size detectors are launch-bound during training: the host
spends more time submitting kernel launches for the forward and backward
passes than the GPU spends executing them, so the GPU idles between
launches. Capturing the network's forward and backward into CUDA graphs
(via ``torch.cuda.make_graphed_callables``) collapses thousands of per-step
launches into two replays.

Only the *network* is captured. The loss stays eager by design: detection
losses are data-dependent (boolean-mask selects, Hungarian matching,
host-side branching on assignment results), which is both illegal during
graph capture and pointless to capture. The optimizer step, gradient
clipping, EMA update and LR schedule also stay eager; they are a small
fraction of step time and interact with GradScaler host-side logic.

Enablement is opt-in per run (``train(..., cuda_graph=True)``). Each model
family that supports capture provides a :class:`CudaGraphTrainSpec` through
``BaseTrainer.cuda_graph_train_spec``; families without a spec silently run
eager, so the flag is always safe to pass.

Shape handling is dispatch-based, not constraint-based: a graph is valid
for exactly the input shape it was captured with, so the manager counts
shapes and captures one graph once a shape has repeated
``warmup_threshold`` times. Batches at any other shape (multi-scale
batches, the last partial batch of an epoch) run eager, unchanged, so a
shape the graph does not cover costs speed and nothing else.

Capture-time contracts (enforced by the trainer, documented here):

- Capture happens lazily on a real training batch, after ``setup()`` has
  finished every model mutation (weight loading, freezing, device moves).
  Replacing a parameter tensor *after* capture would leave the graph
  reading freed storage; in-place updates (optimizer steps, EMA source
  reads, ``load_state_dict``) are safe because replay reads the same
  addresses.
- ``make_graphed_callables`` warm-up runs a few forward/backward passes on
  the capture batch. Its backward goes through ``torch.autograd.grad`` with
  ``only_inputs=True``, so it never writes ``.grad`` and cannot pollute an
  accumulation window (which zeroes only at the window's start, not per
  micro-batch). Stateful buffers (BatchNorm running stats) *are* advanced by
  those extra forwards, so they are snapshotted before capture and restored
  in place afterwards and the buffer trajectory matches eager exactly.
- Under AMP, capture and replay must run with autocast caching disabled;
  the trainer's autocast context handles this when a manager is active.
- Distributed training and distillation are not captured in this version;
  the trainer falls back to eager for those runs.
- A family whose captured region stops matching what the loss needs partway
  through a run (YOLOX adds its L1 branch at mosaic close) calls
  ``BaseTrainer.invalidate_cuda_graph``; the manager drops the graph,
  restores the eager forward and re-captures once a shape settles again.

Any failure to capture, at any point, permanently falls back to eager
training for the rest of the run with a single warning.

Capture is bit-identical for most families. Three documented exceptions,
all inherent rather than defects: families whose own eager training is not
reproducible (deformable-attention atomics, TF32 reduction order) stay
inside that spread; RTMDet's cross-level shared head convolutions sum their
three gradient contributions in a different order; and a network with
dropout or stochastic depth inside the captured region draws its own random
stream on replay (the manager logs this at capture time). See
``docs/training_cuda_graphs.md`` for the per-family table, and
``tests/e2e/test_cuda_graph_training_families.py`` for the gates.

    Capture defaults to ``capture_error_mode="global"``, under which a CUDA
    call from *any* host thread invalidates the capture. A DataLoader with
    ``pin_memory=True`` keeps a pin-memory thread alive that calls
    ``cudaHostAlloc`` whenever it stages the next prefetched batch, so a
    lazy capture taken on a live training batch races with it: the capture
    dies with ``cudaErrorStreamCaptureUnsupported`` and, worse, the error
    poisons the pin-memory thread, which re-raises on the next batch fetch
    and kills the whole run (observed twice on the first RF100-VL Vast
    campaign, as "AcceleratorError ... in pin memory thread").

    ``thread_local`` is PyTorch's documented mode for exactly this
    situation: only the capturing thread is restricted during capture, and
    other threads' CUDA calls proceed normally without being captured. The
    pin-memory thread touches only its own pinned host buffers, never the
    capturing stream, so nothing it does belongs in the graph.
